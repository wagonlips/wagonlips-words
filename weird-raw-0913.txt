"Discoveries in science are made only by near-sighted specialists, while
the influence of public sentiment and policy still works systematically
against enlightenment."

"As legend becomes in a few generations preposterous
myth, so history, after a few rehandlings and condensations, becomes
unblushing theory."

"stimulated artificially, and applied from without; so that art becomes a
sickly ornament for an ugly existence."
--George Santayana, The Life of Reason

"There! and your sweetest sendings, ah divine,
 By it, heavens, befall him! as a heart Christ’s darling, dauntless;
        Tongue true, vaunt- and tauntless;
 Breathing bloom of a chastity in mansex fine.
 
 Frowning and forefending angel-warder
 Squander the hell-rook ranks sally to molest him;
        March, kind comrade, abreast him;
 Dress his days to a dexterous and starlight order."

Discipline is the acquired faculty of surrendering an immediate personal good

Knowledge... is a salutation, not an embrace.

The intelligible, however, lies at the periphery of experience, the surd at its core;

Twenty-six letters may suffice for a language, but they are a wretched minority

A great imaginative apathy has fallen on the
mind. One-half the learned world is amused in tinkering obsolete armour,
as Don Quixote did his helmet; deputing it, after a series of
catastrophes, to be at last sound and invulnerable.

LORD GORING.  Never mind what I say, Robert!  I am always saying what I

LADY WINDERMERE.  Don’t say that, Arthur.  There is the same world for
all of us, and good and evil, sin and innocence, go through it hand in
hand.  To shut one’s eyes to half of life that one may live securely is
as though one blinded oneself that one might walk with more safety in a
land of pit and precipice.
--Oscar Wilde, Lady Windermere's Fan

Actions are the first tragedy in life, words are

LORD DARLINGTON.  What cynics you fellows are!
CECIL GRAHAM.  What is a cynic?  [_Sitting on the back of the sofa_.]
LORD DARLINGTON.  A man who knows the price of everything and the value
  of nothing.
CECIL GRAHAM.  And a sentimentalist, my dear Darlington, is a man who
  sees an absurd value in everything, and doesn’t know the market price of
  any single thing.
--Oscar Wilde, Lady Windermere's Fan

In this world there are only two tragedies. One is not getting what one wants, 
and the other is getting it. The last is much the worst; the last is a real tragedy!
--Oscar Wilde, Lady Windermere's Fan

But there are moments when one has to choose between living one’s own life, fully, 
entirely, completely--or dragging out some false, shallow, degrading existence 
that the world in its hypocrisy demands. 
--Oscar Wilde, Lady Windermere's Fan

DUMBY.  I am [a mystery] -—to myself.  I am the only person in the world I should like
to know thoroughly; but I don’t see any chance of it just at present.
--Oscar Wilde, Lady Windermere's Fan

LORD ILLINGWORTH:  One should never take sides in anything, Mr. Kelvil.
Taking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows
shortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore. 
--Oscar Wilde, A Woman of No Importance

Love is better than wisdom, and more precious
than riches, and fairer than the feet of the daughters of men. 
--Oscar Wilde, A House of Pomegranates 


There is no reason that the sentimentalist should be asked to
interfere. He always does harm. He culminates at his starting point. His
end, as his origin, is an emotion.
--Oscar Wilde, Children in Prison 

We are each our own devil, and we make
This world our hell.
--Oscar Wilde, The Duchess of Padua
   
Suffer me not to see another sun
Light up the misery of this loathsome world.

The Hysterical Woman Kept 1 Lawyer In Your Paper Mouth With 7 Clerks & 3 Spirits

You'll be knocked down
Not with a bang but a whimper
All your works are gone
Nothing but smoke and vapor

You know
You see
You feel... (nothing<--[whispered])

The dawn awakes
The day is long
The noise is loud
And so you sing your damn song

You work your life
You make your way
You trade your sweat 
For another day's pay

You check the box
You make your mark
You seek the light
But you die in the dark

Strength turns to dust

Love first becomes
A memory
Then it fades to dust
And then you're finally free

You fear
Your doom
You die... (alone<--[whispered])

You'll be knocked down
Not with a bang but a whimper
All your dreams are gone
Nothing but smoke and vapor

I can't remember what the hell I was going to put here...

The sin we had done once with loathing we would do many times with joy.
The curtain went down on a titter and some groans.
What was youth at best? A green, an
 unripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts. -- The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde

The narrative was already under way when I came across it in the dark recesses of my mind.
At first it paid me no mind, just carried on as if it didn't know I was there.
And then it seemed bothered by my presence, as if it had some right to natter on in privacy. 
Turning its back on me, it inserted a derisive phrase or two, never faltering in its rambling,
but making its message clear: "Buzz off." But this was my head, mine! And I wasn't about to let
some half-assed revery take over, was I? I couldn't just let this rogue screed run roughshod 
across the wood planks of the theater of my mind. So I hunkered down and checked it out. 
I carefully perused it, and I wasn't impressed. I wasn't impressed at all. It was a
silly narrative with an embarrassment of asides, none of which had any relevance to anything 
important, each one would be a derailment of the main thread, if only there had been a main 
thread. It had a motley crew of unlikable characters milling about and never coming to much. 
It was so saturated with cliche phrases hardly a sentence could finish without tripping over 
some sort of hackneyed clap-trap. And it completely lacked conflict. Nothing was happening 
at all. It just went on and on like the noise of the freeway. And like freeway noise, this 
narrative had a dark undertone, a sort of creeping banality that you felt in your bones that 
would certainly, inevitably lead to some sort of anti-spectacular fatality, 
'death by boredom' would be the cause. 


But it's more than that. We have dinner all the time without desert. Desert's not that big
of a deal. But the orgasm, that's a big deal. I dragged my wife to a therapist once, well
more than once, but... this particular therapist said that the orgasm was not the "be all, 
end all." What a jerk. I think he was simply taking my wife's side in the discussion because
her body language was making it seem like I've been beating her down on this issue. But it
might also be that he simply sucks at sex. But if the orgasm isn't the "be all, end all" of
sex, then what is?

The orgasm is more than just the ending, it's the primary driving factor of the entire act.
We are animals and this is how our reproductive mechanisms work. Insert pointy thing into
moist hole, apply friction, transfer genes. Simple. Human culture has for millenia focussed 
on the differences between man and woman, but honestly they're minor. We all have the same
blood in us, same number of limbs, fingers, toes. We all eat the same food which we all 
convert into the same sort of poop. Any creature not of the human species would be able to 
tell us apart about as well as we can differentiate male from female hamsters, or bugs. And
so my point is we're not that different. The idea that this act should favor one sex or the
other is an odd one. If one of us can have an orgasm, then the other one can, too. Simple.

If you're religious you
probably have some crazy, guilty ideas about why it feels good. And that's cool. Guilt can
be fun, as long as you're not persecuting others because of your own kooky beliefs. But all
that really matters is that it does feel good. Let's call it the happy coincidence. It 
feels great, but it comes with some caveats: may lead to conception
and is an excellent vector for disease. Let's call those the mixed coincidence and the
unhappy coincidence. We can and should take measures to mitigate the mixed and unhappy
coincidences; we cannot make them go away entirely but if we're careful the risks they present
are no greater than other risks we suffer every day in normal life. That leaves one thing:
happiness. Arguably the greatest happiness that can be had in this world for the least 
amount of work. It is available to people of all stripes, creeds and dispositions and it
requires no financial investment at all. The only investment any of us have to make to enjoy
sex is that we take a risk. If you're going solo, you may risk being discovered. To enjoy
sex with a partner, you risk being hurt in some way. 

And that's actually a really big risk. What started out as a bit of fun is now life-threatening.
 
it takes away the majority of the investment and nearly all of the vulnerability. And 
that's the part that I miss the most. Making oneself vulnerable, to me, is what sex is all
about. We call the orgasm the "little death," and therefore the sex act is kind of like
murder. But if you don't have an orgasm yourself, you can only be guilty of manslaughter.
