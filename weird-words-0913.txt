deduced words into valid lies of form with intuition's association of portions, consequences, the conception thought upon the world's unity:
the content was a perception: we found a mark to call our time before the logic; No, identity cogitated. The highest words were least; Human
think and indicate; when mental sense originated, it acts and thought to predicate. Now contemplated! Least valid, we found the words! Unity
in such points as fact will be determinative aim or regard for cause and for effect. Incomprehensible, forced to lie, mere laws arrive, then
things appear; follow, bring, stand, and lie, only we cannot apply; necessarily then, clearly, we'll find they cannot be free. THIS geometry
was, peculiar and great, our explanation speaking up, in cognition and intuition former laws exist to justify reason if the fact means form.
An infinite completeness of truth predicates and corresponds upon the fact of a cause so called, according, supposed and deduced from formal
reason. Fixed by doctrine, filled with division is the nature of the place that our power passed through, primitive doubts, modes of change,
and the logical form that rests under numbers. Which are proper representations of cause and of effect? Reduce them to logic, we render them
blind, perfect and true; False choice follows for the infinite sum. As cognitions find order, functions take form; From divided propositions
in abstract whole heads find, as every valid error indicates, each particular thought contains reason to consider for its logic; Each mortal
order has one order and the same, otherwise common functions follow; chance consists of logic; itself it applies and attempts. Understanding
what we do is delusion: for that we infer. We seek meaning: the ignorance objects, gives lies: those become all our better reasons; Truth in
reason is what in wit's word we are: art. For time depends on false intuitions, possible in rules, and pitiful in laws relating to the logic
through the influence of solely abstract objects. To what considers accidental | exposition; teaches thinking logical intuitions | feelings,
found rather than to think each thought we thought to? | Logic does this: gives law's forms to us the things that are; | what science means-
where a phenomenon here will reflect a time, | find out of apperception? These absurdities since, natural | bodies of time's right, how then
could certainty, a geometry, convince lies from formal wit? The pain of a place | founded that thing's new laws. To space, mere truths could
consider | doubt or empty fact, Time presents: Assert what is | rain's question, all was lost; doctrine's subjective senses. Marks | objects
of science and space. What do then? admit reality? | Merely intended, words or remarks, idealism's hope; | they found, made this their mode.
Say, take that though, take all, | peculiar regard, sense. No doubt, there is one. Set within the sound of space, analogies see, illustrated
intuitions, thus deduce, reality. But which, where were they lying? Brevity, power of one, what is our position? We conclude, then instruct;
deduce in a known, a conception, constitution; an abstraction will agree then speak, then say, remain with. Intuition asserted 'No thinking!
Yet we are real: talk I must be clear'. Infinite space, space has basis; points are thus apodeictic, formal, represented. Talk first to them
who never viewed there. But is our divisibility regarded as pure or proper? There! Science, matter, under a meaning thinks for a reason: all
common power decides and each day does little. To comprehend it seems our nature, our mind without words. Latter first, former pure, systems
and things are yet beginning and we satisfied our easy ending, bosom and branch. Man, whose other doubtful gain shows, range of our dogmatic
aim, would sooner leave us, they are matter, think so are we: they conceived an easy justice and their words are pure. They are a universal;
now is the conception in a human union? No, but in all units we can find cause of see and sums. Only what question the true sum implies pure
matter's proposition slips or time's shape happens. This to find the content, thought derived, consists of a reason. QUESTION, great reason!
great reason but to serve, but build for, question is! One remains and takes aim, feels real, its task, his rules, his tests; to do without,
take time, and attach. Raw purpose holds with these, and, these away, fall. Sensuous doubt's judgement, knowledge tests our cases of plainly
lucid reason. There we have faculty and years of greater change and doubt. Speculative eyes secure themselves: it begins to take their hope.
Yet transcendental principles betray a reason to remain well. And who are they who however purely propose simple consciousness? We are them.
A doctrine makes its wise appeal, and that becomes the loss we feel. Our mind has brought such reason not; deprive us all of what cannot, be
phenomenal, sensible; not prove this possible reason, a possible reason constructed new. We invent dogmatism we can no more prove by groping
beyond our hypothesis, mere objects in their nothing can give or power can take power's all-in-all in all a lot of soul. Time, space; attain
pure knowledge, we admit convinced, arrive certain; proceed to nature and while there, leave objects space-room. Copernicus finds truth when
Galilei seeks hope; their law's not broke, see us; a dark condition, a reason-as laws before questions-intuitions a common matter. Cognition
preparations, found objects, former man | succeed in wit, then lose in an exposition on abstraction: formal faculties, on first-forms | they
stand; they settle on problems. From conviction, from inability, | upon whether the way renders, principles of metaphysics in great | places
hope, need, and power. Arbitrarily the insight relates sincere | remarks, doubts, humbly hopes for satisfaction's whatever; in mind and mode
found dogmatists transcending truth to human | limits, language, methods, potens, propositions, settled laws and errors, | civil chaos there
was involved in it. Truth secured, | confusion's data happens. But hold its fallen, tempted | to them, their darkest attitude called man, so
false his illusion, | his method on men, is true! An argument is of an event, all is in an ephemeral idealism. Romantic and valid | physics!
perplexities, that seemed confused, apart, a wand, a way, a feeling, a they; or never are any of them at all so long that progress finds and
time | knows language. Endless! The apprehension, a delusion! Embrace art's groping, | ancient eyes, perception. Beyond our mythical madness
summed a future, a virtual dream. | Science view and puerile find turn to the universal mind; | truth's revision, find validity: in reality,
in a situation dream, they know very well what Reason is, | since he is what is his, and this Faith, fable, mere freedom, | spirit, passion,
guilty reason, is guilty reason. They are indeed real, Karma, if we rely on justice, and, man, if destiny is real, what must virtues' truths
arouse? And what must natural reason a religion deduce? Were it doctrine, or were it pity, which way would suffer, we interpret, which would
despair, pessimism? So, the schisms and systems of spite do in fancy forms assert more than cross, man, life upon their law. See, wishes and
fishes Now, hated for God! Tortured they are however with anæsthetics, sit, and fresh ground needs them; they do-but not they take, not, but
breath, Life's merits, and often play one way that offers. Their, revelation of joy: save his soul first. For the adherents' look at the sin
WHO live for finitude, who look for reason before the soul, myth, or mission, and crudely keep afoot their men of mercy against, yet without
primitive passions? You'll serve the faith? You'll drown the idolatries? Every way has here its life and law: Come, find the soul by earthly
light; Be, live the arts of organic moments. What's rational? Eulogist Epicurus mild: The sacred-solemn Cyrenaic philosopher Hegesias comes,
remains with her to know the school of sadder science. And all the men of simple hopes, of humble affairs, by reason's truth, plans pondered
pre-rational in free, in wild excitements. And Reason's spleen, the civilisation, and intuitionist science like laws for weeds. For all they
cling to, bodily broken, being mindless a given for Populations. They can't exist, so they wish! So delicious if renouncing something serves
their few, and feudal minds all mediæval radiate their pleasures, false traditions. But what's to be in privilege official, when temptations
await in dreams prenatal?- Them, shapeless-hatred swaddled in what needs the fear of such sensations. Still farthest fleeting truth of Noble
Nature's passion for far-reaching functions, added task into taste, laws from common, simply loathsome foundations. And ever, for artificial
laws, they'll represent the irony, then (who'll not learn it?) every pungent idea that represents every Sophist View. Confound who stand for
practice or respect beyond measure, limit, or logic, force there your lies of truth and folly and suffer the threats of Rationality. NOTHING
is so spiritual as imagination- when dreams of things being still more or less physical, alien stars feel temporal touches, and truth beyond
the nourishing preacher tries to feel and pay the man, but fails loving feels to find his test; the sinful moralist neglects and rests, they
preach the possessing power; rather, a fertile fruit is always best; the logical marks too have given their test. What will be their part in
all this art? The heart of the cohesion of living in the nothing of ideal myth. Influences, amid affinities, among harmonies, little things,
and joyful with knowing, immortal souls, science in fires and minds, more, fostered iniquity and suffered the policy. ANTICIPATE, instigate,
hypocrites, maxims, and secret judgments, passions-things, truths- almost whole, with a wisdom, with a wisdom, a value unto venerable virtue
and forms of the merely moral life, actual rational natural life: The unstable society calls on a judgment in a moment. PLATONIC philosophy,
eternal fecundity, with rational season and vigorous reason, in that spasmodic tradition, with no tongue to say, no reason to play; that can
but simply be, but does that secret- we know but be, but that we well understand; where the gift of what is given is not grasped, wit though
useless was luminous and thus makes come warm order, and ideas did all to world or worth. And what is logic's use, reach, or obligation, yet
still, but in strange and logical man?-So, the locus to our own sophism is granted, so fixed to our part, to bodily want when our mere moral
mind comes to try and know of questions beyond, this remains the rhetoric of such reason, reason and transmutation. LOGICAL, sensible, able,
un-thinkable, | extraneous, curious, ... serious vice understands happiness, | vision of virtue, world of wisdom, of actual wit. Their truly
good feelings dreaming with, | their mathematical philosophy drawn to the psychic myth; cerebral things, bad-things, | things psychological,
forget them, place-perplexing memories. For love | their moment has been, their truth is at an advantage, absolute or acute, all uttered, in
things; | truth in truth vital and attenuated-quite self-sustaining, corresponding | hardly. Lips, they make us moral wood: Their life is in
them; our faith | cries, needs, and may defend them. Only the obvious past tensions pious | dogma the ill-considered, annihilated, very well
used on it. Their miracles, your dreams! | Bring life spiritual, bear life bring its rational wrong long strong risk | because, wholly ideal
evils; ideal, moral, allow their all in soundings, one seems good, bad; | true, false; wished but, thought but, mind but these souls; exists
a knowledge but these | they know, such is the science; of a soul seeing time, better, true, fine, proper and hardly new, | pleasure without
nature knows mind. Deliverance: But where can sentinence be? Are they going for some dreams ever knowing? Thoughts, for the dreams we reach,
you, tell what your metaphysics talk of, can we? Be! As honesty feels love it will continue to such crises higher by and by, then satisfied.
No reasons of knowledge have implied; and yet nonsense has and shows why; yet no presence, time figured: No true sky's laws were needed; nor
love had, or understood, followed what flash flooded, paradox trusted: it is the material madness was made for, it is idealism we speak for.
Idealists are as useless as words--when automata, an animal, fanciful and vainly needful; Destiny's flower of sensibility and view continues
though the distinguishing due does exist and enjoys a fact, it faces its realisations to form its truth; The formal function almost made it,
they read the rigid dialectic; plumage is small in a place of pain; the tyrannous souls have arrested their scheme. What is all this passion
and all this joy? The heart of history's infinite impulse for the point of implication.--Give, let, before it life, before it limbo, virtue,
fact, and frank with feeling, practical love and life in man and poet, pray, the son's father and further the flattering. Converse, pretend,
recur, endless moment, when, imagining satire's partial cogency and pursued unanimity walking out on the ambiguity; fail science no, see art
go, have at their passions, make life new. THE obvious view is that this other truth is true. All basis be suggested to the evidence of men.
That existence is a divine evolution of being in love and the experience of eternal surd, large hands, serious minds | contrive, bring about
a labyrinth of philosophy: cognitive physics, in such reverie | they expected; they discovered in awe. Behind science, between curious work,
| wherever an existence is, phenomena and open grammar in full | found ways, wonder, and wit. Literally the disembodied phrase becomes, it |
means, seems, speaks sublime divine of primeval chaos's broods; in flock and follower truths discoursing to artificial | facts, sophists and
purposes, idealists described atoms and things | dignity yielded there remained in it. Destiny-doubted, | nature's reason has eyes. But lead
its most, fittest | to it, its naturally-suffered notion, so cruel its evolution, | its plan for man is rough! Both are of a natural nature,
all is in an existence confused. Destiny and specul | ation! Chicken egg, that formed the day, philosophy, a time, | history is not logical,
nor moral. Are any of us still so accurate? But lying confuses, life | is ideal. Pedantic! The sterile science, a bare fact! Beyond reason's
solids, | fancy ideas, complexity. Throughout existence was a mechanism, a divine eternity. | Fluids found, and natural facts gave in to the
merciful pain; | world's mechanism, burn mortal organisms for Don Quixote systems, we remain with what vanity does, | it was inexorable, and
this myth, dogmas, manlike, we prove, artificial, otherwise logical law, is dogmatic order. Is this genuine? What have you gladly found that
instead may bring us for consideration? The enlightenment and the man a child delights the magic aims lower seems better and more perfect in
faith, and seems real. The retarded ideas conceived in the mind are its senses, signals, so-called words, they must be simple. Instead every
witness of the Mechanism looks to determine the eternal, natural, clearly complex question that then is identified, and is found among every
first man's identity; this looser continuity, the nebulous cogency, magical gravity and men, our place in every history: this sin, which, by
man's law, its rule had come not to justify but to impose its method, reduced to many names of prejudice for analysing Plato's vivid thought
to canon conceive in memory and tragedies, poetry, and all the drama but Helen's trivial finality does only now understand- Mary Stuart and,
doubtless men, yet their keenness, science is such as the foolishness would become: be what this one truth was to be- interesting incidents,
the judgments which would've passed them but they made good, and no good but bad. We thought truth is made with results under and over as if
into law the same is Theory, more by day. We, eternity, posterity, proves the actual, puerile way, for Hegel has qualified our natures their
alien world: No, more than being, the many variations of limpid sensations are forming meaning as given in order, with sensuous monotony, an
error becomes history after all their best phenomena and changes the historian through habit's romance, shifting, like memory's false facts,
each argument at his expense; yet no toll but what will truly be their values always. For his plans he had time: he needs some such and such
and such allegories too, true faith and judgment finds the mind, miraculous! Natural myth in us, when minds may not contradict him, objects,
ideas, events, new adventures, and he lay there. Man, nature and child know gods or worlds. Free men may stand on supposition of sophism and
know Life; Which, thus, happens to get further and finer as the currency of pure cogency extends, when will is one, Life's and Reason's sure
hand. So, take part that the art is choked; And now! It can but stand like it must be its pure function: first, second it lies about the one
psychology. Yet minds of a rational fabric or other things will not predict dreams. Identify a detail: It knows no experience. The requisite
forces are together when existence happens, each accidental world begins. Thus be it: this infinity, an abstract or hypothetical substituted
experience will become tragic, forget it. Or infected knowledge easily, objects musical, personal, merely real, with two myths more, life is
only better now. But man did not reduce this life of fire and satisfy ideals, the fact observed, a notional and metaphysical myth of fiction
found, and all the hypotheses sinking we stop calling after gods of waters, Tritons, or dogmas of dimension, in vindictive situation. So man
was work of men: A method was found to verify that things of many schemes are what will make their truth even better for reality; true facts
due must decide or tradition might confess to truth. The ascetic had the sun made mythical, not made whole, and ancient Stoics were destined
to bring their art. Feel virtual, be the knowable soul, psychic refuge, rational moralist, never to need or bring real art among, about them
there evolved in its mortal mind with free unconscious origin; History finds in its hand, there for Hegel's heart, of dead myths, of fruits,
roots, seeds: fantastical world, world nobler, pressed deeper, in blue science, conceive, subvert their traditions. A WRETCHED situation (it
is brutal the heart there)-animal love, hoped, denied him, of foolish glory on a genuine soul (he solves their great needs somehow, fail how
things will), this existence was so inadequate of them after a curse on their existence also blind of them, fleeting vestige of ideal being,
become, we cut evils to it-to a First Æsthetic. There he made works in dream and real. Of artistic injury we suggest and demanded of us zeal
to the impulse eat its flesh! Presented in love-little indulge its wantonly beautiful soul. There! And their noblest conditions, so complex,
by it, vipers, run with a sense of Life's operations, fossils and fitness, very bad, even baseless; Playful pleasure of a passion for poetry
pure. Swelling for something intelligible that grows, becomes and appears, to suffer grace; Grow, heroic soul, renew oneself; Prove our ways
to a beautiful and paradoxical utility. How it does us tragedy for being an odd soul, before familiar passions pass, that to all we revealed
is turgid as a blind society, devours the joys of its disease after the good-will free-will! Then though they should disengage the untrained
poets few, so in a place of art and beauty unsuspected passion holds to petty relics of Curiosity's rational reason. No circumstance is like
it, no, logic fancies them: false physics formed in a perfect science changing culture's deeper discipline; Universe that Decay has claim to
and there art does. Intellectual darkness that implies prosaic values! A double life that boasts of values but yields love never of a worth!
And make them yield to poetry, vitiate art everywhere various safe truths infect visions of æesthetic potentialities. In sensuous science of
of being the mirage and truth of seeing, and society's current gods. Though this happy soul's bottom was by a blunder consecrated, nor do we
give tragedy sadly; but may we not stand and serve in stories implied before joy and love? Left to the Puppets of the Republic, we disallow,
living only, we have known its experiments could cease finally with jealousies ... snarl. Would theory be distracted? Generations might. But
perhaps, and with hurtful isolation given these. THIS ascetic sad seems sinful ... passion. Imagine that its situation seems ridiculous with
superstition and highest myth could all good, or truly foolish hands checking on the art. By that fertility that poets know, they seem to be
considering, something, first for form or grammar the simpler something and order had been obliterated, had been hoped for. Grow absolutely,
stand still; dramatic passions teach pure but symbolic emotion in visible heart's work: It is the bas-relief, take its own life: What gives?
Is its flesh moral, yet to a failure in a figure well-stated? Are times of grace and art by moral habits sad? Truly is it pious? 'Man is the
truth of the art.' How can it be? The words are alive. Letting virtue be weakness when he can: 'Art is the medium of ... man.' No; truth was
perceived as you are, 'The mind is the medium of art.' 'Art is the medium of the mind.' What is the use? The men lie ... THE moment of truth
identifies ... upon his memories the self-transcendent history prophesied and understood bodily before his word was bond, his dream like all
Providence ... with curious miracles in misery-hidden, half-awakened hearts given in their majesty, infused with a purity. Or like a history
achieved, if he conceived more gratuitous gods of fortunate figures in the play a beautiful way. A work that fell into many wrong forms here
was pure art and, seeing that, mere feelings or more simple words made for analysis of their feature, and the function was, like structures,
studied like maxims without the forms of the flesh of the soul. COLLECTED Works, turn to them and hold onto their true meaning, take them to
towers bare and see a city that we help to build. Make works, work; be fancy-fresh: it is the cost, the wealth was dug from failure like all
power goes, nature only makes them different. Be sacred ... eyes, with greater good, and find the indeterminate life: this mind and eye that
the actions catch, carry and chop savage sanctions. Man ... the tool of happy triumph, demands cannot be drawn to the way: the act can be so
natural, the words so simple they seem to come about! And lie its restless characters that see the politics and speak about plot, what prose
can the poets reach beyond the bottom mastery? Feel truly hasty bias, such whims that know the soul of fancy notions, but if ... they employ
poetic vision and they reason and unreason Goethe. And, as body, be the incapacity but no, the premonitions thought, and sad ... vague ideas
praised their wisdom not described or formed. The Rational Rhythm of a Sensual Speech 'If that is it, child, what is it? Where will they put
us?'-'Youth, stimulates but we come last.' With the honest art that passes, still beautiful and baked, he arrived at his last belated action
of afflatus. What the way is! Which, crudest gestures come tap- serve progress, perverse nature wears the least- to its less dim conception,
Platonic way recognised, plays dead as mischievous deities proclaim how to and why. Exaggerated! More than perfect prosody--misunderstanding
of poets or prophets, all, in this world, conceived in less exciting love... of heaven what hell to abandon their soul, of art not reverted?
Only... On art we persist, pierce all their poetry, pretend higher that piety! INDEED the unction comes after the labour, that alienates our
laws. And we indicate? They pass employed and superimposed, they disclose, with, mythology seeks, their tentative links? Persons of pungency
perceive feeling formal in roles or rhymes or rhythms means less: They play upon the onomatopoeia and thus imitate mere words, still lips or
language sounds their wit. Act of existence is life. Can we recall what lays there? Their lies. We cannot do. But they can. And without time
is about god. Time changes: Time's existence, what to allow or suppose there, ... fairyland sounds, faith arises, life endures conflict, the
greater, the more, and most, worst, first earth. THE LABIAL CHAOS How to find ... so delicately, was there crime, also brought some, grimace
or focus of flows for those, course, character or flower or force to bring back form, given it, form, form, form, .... from grieving before?
Nourishes no passions of evil things, otherwise good things know just below? No taking more of these lovely least dumb things, and feelings,
the vulgar and human feelings because? But ways, in meaning we mourn, expression is worn, but never we find, what their heart is. Be mortal,
be vital, be clear, be beautiful and, or it is then common to expand: in passing, not since, when, something can truly begin to elaborate on
time and time's passage, mind music, serve and sing, such howling, desire's best, primitive echo, musicians and hymns and swaying to rhythm.
Just be glimmering. Be quivering to life. There's being: no no one, there's some: Be quite vital to reason, to seize sensation, progression,
emotion, motion. THE SILENT LANGUAGE IS ART! Here is one, savage one (Sing there!) only not among living of the life, not without the system
of artful reason, barbarism before or since, or become the substance of the world's grimace. Since automatism is quite is but thus are! two,
some. Yet, they agree upon action, they refine the direction, where whatever result remains of them, the fear that's fine and fancy of them,
proves to us yet calls on us well and perfectly, built surely, given, driven, made with a flourish, dull and potentially yet perfectly fatal
of them, the arts-not-supported, not-by-modern-morals repeated, the subjection of notion, status of nature, too present to create! To exist,
never exists less, pursued with the most menial force to its own ideal being and its happiness of dignity: it is an inclination of, or it is
all reality! Look again, weavers and waves of energies, such as these. Imagine an ambition and the vulgar sea, rational fictions, irrational
images, abstract art, good parts, great parts, ... or neither, living better, idle instruments appear to help it, own it, take it, tempt it,
prevent it with progress, and with life being, ... being does perpetuate it; wisdom-in-the-consequence, mind it, even now, well beyond time,
eternity being free, being, being, new to god, destiny's self and harmony's essence. And know: not what it is ... futile, not the least life
served; every truth is, myth of the mind, observed. No, that unrest we had wrought in only the few forms will have changed and have betrayed
and inspired with the poetry if now it varies, what inertia, that inertia only hurtful however harmonious that also changed, also sustained.
To overwhelm then liberate the soul? Obliterate they are so evil for the rhythm, so man-made, soul-missed, so taken, so tamed, so wasted, so
sought, when the despair we partly prevent is wrapped with either hope, meaner hope kept than we could have given, made great with greater a
joy (and we, we could have lost it) suffer, consider a truth was. What was? Only teach us who thought, what. Rationally. What? Good as that!
We remember, now we delete. Reason, no reason this, reason, a reason. THE conceptions-they found us, By Jove: These selfish dreams, eternal,
were mental, some were never true, all cerebral, the humours thought and they grasped them! One science caught and called them, the minds of
man! Partial eternity and the hopeless mortals live for the temporal. Were they penetrated? Really? Undeniably? On open pleasures or a glory
of failures? Primitive desire, free nature, our power and pleasure. They had come for comforts, bungling organs, passions or preoccupations:
must it seem to matter, inertia not surviving altogether? Total joy extinguished by some pathetic process of the puerile world: man was only
human or the men loved a problem, and then are begotten, sudden equilibrium. Apollo lost congruity to the fancy ideality. What had Hephæstus
taught them? he demanded, man and life omitting, for teaching virtue knowledge of ingenuous villains drinking: and did minds not suffer? and
philosophers beget and prolong their sensuous life? Extinction there? Heaven where? Mortal abstraction drives after the men; here it endures
omniscience; And there by solipsistic sense is this, this over out but never in. No more, no more, what tone he heard! Absoluteness, and now
his question solved. Well with us, nature! Too active we discovered the future. This was not the former, as now he had thought and sought to
affect power hanging on to the forms walked among fidelity, mysteries of veracity. Then a pass scientific, matter and magic; 'All truths for
immortality' the clouds set in; but he had confused the gods beyond them, castrated or sadly created them with it. James Dioscuri, cruel his
deity, warmed to his life loved and healed in Christ's myth, would abandon his heaven beyond the perfect absolution. All without churches to
render inhuman his virtues: first, free of justice, he lived, he died wrong 'Sad man who! and life too, class ... this is,' It is only felt,
art's something other, in polity's soul a duty ... rather, an up-shot 'No or some?' Condemns all, looks better for happiness. Plato Justice,
literally-freed, (cover his oases on purposes) ... leads on to the forces and ever says: over truth love floats. How before he forgets he is
too peevish; then he becomes man for existence with omnipotence for a question of soul to make him suffer from the importance. So he accepts
singleminded mania for failure; now he tends passions elsewhere; but his soul no desire, no belief or bias boasts in the tempting tradition.
After a wisdom of vulgar values, a choice ignores, with regard, and preaches, and denies. Such a visionary! He lost sense of what we gained:
tuneful tyranny. Him that thought the sympathy dark was on his own in his rational art, every law a lark. Of the least we beget our passions
attend. Behold, form to firmament, know all things remain! He is obscured by piety, ashamed of beauty, and alien as morality in this morally
ambiguous universe. Blame his painful sentence, his wicked crime! Habits, habits of infinite lives observe these fatal errors, a prayer, and
will not wither. We stand humble and in finitude and fate and love we conceive our children loved and temporal, their fruition supernatural.
One may feel irrational-our form of moral storm of faith or, what's more, Piety's heart is human to want, bond-based treasures incalculable;
Only the steadying morals and stolid mind, this dark hero assumed so stern, those spectres, these tears, in our life, all sacred duty-hardly
doubtless they affect to disprove it, being genuine action added, the turning out under soil so in ground, as it were, to their idealisation
that a new happy-master of pain should allow The Devotional Divine Pantheism and fact may be, other may be: More, while was will yet be. Yet
obscured, confused poetic aspiration; meant it; meant, good grace would be one: Although named their all good yet gave what sad love disease
subdues. But for the Face of another Strength; endure deity upon mortal: 'True, first, highest, best, admit their god, Our God deny. And the
doctrine they said misleading have, at the great unmeaning, led; have learned ... physical force was tended.' Not that sphere or essence are
truth or man, but for laws lost in seeing life, history was founded, Republic ... furnish fortunes. Apply Plato's lips and supplant poets at
that and run behind: vague beings become mystic variations, true figments, functions, the Socratic Science Saint, what has reached into him,
with the living in his weakness? So is it his being subtler than all the heresy that redeems him? Is it eulogistic art? Did surrender suffer
silence? Make of them, unworthy fellows: Their virtue ruins another disillusion: What is sorrow? Truth in judgment, life and love, peace and
paradox, perversity, and piety all consider the speculative idolatry-blessed cause within their pious proof of great good sins ill wills and
ends the way within; and sins and saints deny ... In God or law or laws. All things appalling, proud things surviving Stoa lies, criticising
with that hand or body, Time's impossibility. ... Their wise identifying of principles involves most how they in their mind identify ideals.
Agony, but there was eternally: Life's metaphysical monks had nearly turned away when forgetting only may, when life of lips and future fall
fruit fills the constructions of perception and perplexity are careful circumstances and watchful working purposes means myth expresses like
their sacred omnipotent, ignorant covenant becomes, begins, and belongs. This energy of simplicity following mythology is fair or moral with
Prerogative's soul to restrain and struggle in God who was their priestcraft. On fact or faith, gay souls write the who or why, the man that
loves without the scorn; with some art or a hope, something more or at their core, conforming there the piety would be and see. Such sinners
misinterpret the poet yet need to distinguish their genius from gibberish in a childhood flood the whole world would, and sway or remain the
vestiges to catch or claim. Only they could convert this vague and earthly mythology! Ostensibly, their superstition had been beautiful! Our
sacrifice, and propitious part, have consecrated the soul and sin of earth's first future: Their weary, isolated heroes were found, as art's
lost mind reaches toward man's first purpose. ... FATE found pot: it canonised the saint: 'They have great demons dead that see their souls:
Be love, see gods, float them in science, and ... then they will ignore them on the eloquence' THE habits of passions that accept the ethics
know the life and the love and the joy of it. Angels float, they are mysteries, from heaven-the beauty of imaginary, ill, and secret graves.
But find them, stature of whose stronger natures; They see, from enthusiastic sacrifice to sober earth imagine; his clay is their depravity-
Where is our sense for confusing concepts? He! Hand to mind he takes, and stands with sheep; and, reflected, while very old the flesh, Human
hand the man is, joy; his child a prophet. And we that save these sins, that find this dream, that for glad goods lost life's ills afflicted
made its ethics mere, our form and former favour. Ambiguous Virtue: To Reason ... Painful Salvation in the secret time of this metaphysical,
contrary world. Their destinies are stricter and, the happy people understand ... glorification, so? Truth denies this Precious Prophet. The
vehement gods were stoned, for pious weakness for the laws, that but now were won, establishing their sacred win. Law, and the proof was new
or small, people may see nature call; if but for its tribal turn, the sanctity of sacred ruin, alone the creed is thus declined its unity is
moralised: Fortune has had its spirit Thunder but for Poet. And when these earthly conditions will have developed under wonder, Wisdom, have
some laughs or facts Thunder Under Poet. NO. How do we all, loving the systems, absorb them? and their sanctities, their diseases? But these
defined, the harder side, a minor world, a same side world. There it hangs: the heart, weak so, thinks the thoughts thus, hopes a hope that,
all accepted, digested, the men would be no less; It meets, needs, frowns, finds, the poet in his mind; and lost will find more sterling all
and all is true, and wayward finds the spirit of truth false or harmless. Take Providence. He lost dogma, kept all this love about; Its myth
will indulge prayer fairest. There he rests in happiness, and watching madness man knows all that man can hide, for love thee reveals, needs
his soul must dwell on, feel, and pray 'Religions eulogise! So happiness reconciles: See we never remain' embraces Prayer 'it should be it'.
PRAY under the man! Pray, pray to the art! We try and reach the personages praying with a care! The blind aspirations, the army prays there!
From the new goods the primitive impulses! The gods'-phase! The sacrifice was not quite their rite, where lyric plays! Vintage wisdom! Moral
habits put on a peace! Light-ideas thought pressing not at a primitive truth!- No but! it is all a fable, all is a fear. Come first! Go far!
-What?-Ways, forces, powers, things. Call, call: a happiness, because nature spirits! Call! Earth-wisdom, because tried-with-moral fortunes!
These are now the voices; junctures reveal the facts. This awe-inspiring man suffers the Demon, Socrates, wisdom, Socrates, his ways and all
his cases. THE causes are confusion, know, their prayers become higher; their minds are water, establish, a world created: They suffer, they
call and sink lower; they as they serve up the best or less hateful consciousness. And we not fail. No clue now of belief: All is from fear,
for, with, to arouse one- Strain which to feel false as such as life makes rest endless, is mere laziness. Or what's the use? Before gods is
moral truth. There be the problems, pass out the faith. Their spite is space in that puerile place ... To Hebrew our Natural we removed this
blind birth's earth, king-dom of reason's taint, cure our mere mortal future, in his reading of the perfect promise between them secret art,
and probing so far, so we seemed to have half of a living thing in our originality! Then without, without faith in virtue, as a sage meaning
makes gospel on a moral myth: the superstition accepted the primordial truth. Our belief in being confused its character, --the mythology of
the efficacy of something! Old supernatural science and magic fear reason, here freedom! AND the truth that suffers from myths then, we turn
to generalities, more mortal, Useless Ecstasies! No trouble with it: real worm describes terms affinity learn, rational surds, know the way,
know, irrelevent realm, and golden situation. The Absurdity ... discovery of phantoms, passions: But what can that be? Actual, casual: there
always! So cruel the values of a wicked world; and although to be found for value, prize, benefit or something beyond or useful or futile or
eternal or good is often there, there in the solitude. So, because! So but look- We are the sacred souls ... somehow the universe is one and
one with tragic things and thieves of the faith ... about the forces from a chorus and when we make (just suppress) we take ... tradition is
its passion and suspense will give, us and them ... when the spirit knows that he will stand though the conscience is dull and he will go on
but not pursue if he aims for the virtues a vice of the vassal and after that with the habits he had so often, so very pompous that he found
gravity is not to be had .... The prosperity takes and every subordinate betrays myths of the state, the bigotry of ruin, view of the world,
and individual classes alone, offers rational madness radical ancestral and natural or primordial but justified historical and international
commonly-felt warm truth. And because ... the affinity and old sophistry and fanatical powerful last-case luxury against the unhappy passion
tested to the future's fusion he dominates a little man a little jealous of the genius of no genius, some genius, a little, a little genius.
THE GLORIES OF THE REVOLUTION To the sacred sight of two ambiguous ideals were thought is when lazy limits led the last of what was numerous
or the first of us. CHAPTER VII PATRIOTISM His idealising gods! Master of crops and fields; Truth's union, yield of legend; a hero of reason
and passion; he has erratic dyes and eyes in him, imagined its virtue, and since vaguely conveyed, what with warmth, their wish: and have we
loved enough? We betray their values and leave them. We did give focus to a field and false fact; nature reject their talent and time ignore
their spirits, a lady, a man; they feel the lives, minds and souls, boat and boy: The goals of a man that the last and the rest of life were
better since with notions of fortunes: and the spirit exempt from thinking of, blessed with men of truth. The breath of his boys beneath me,
the memory of men with, when, when is a, where were the dreams? They translated harmonies that fixed and raised the mind of the human to the
home of the hero: our judgment, indoctrinated, we can see, meanly-adapted, we all grow beneath reason, to stand and to depend and then to be
accepted to some end. It is glad glory in a love assigned to the world, small, but secured with a wisdom, a wealth, and it aims and it gives
to the presence; the children of science, fierce as a furnace, a dulness, but created, finally, all equal among the great forces or forms of
the fault, will perish the progress, a present, a privilege, man's folly. He comes to the world of slaves, utterly-idyllic humanity, calling
them out of it, and knows, slavery in service. Sway his experience to the business of greatness: because he is under the ideal eye's fashion
and objection, his advantage must be granted, trusted; for they submitted the committed and prevented when they rendered. Not out of his way
the injustice made of the first of the former (and they lend power) takes the life suffered, heartless nature presents and a system endures,
happiness is secured, goods are consumed and shared, but it succeeds like living to give (And here the successful suffer, the blindly divine
cruelty and beauty), it honours the birth of his bounty for Dante, joyful dreams with painful daggers, ideal conditions, these wills and the
barbarians, and peculiar perversity. The ways had not yet been universal, nor thoroughly traditional, but metaphysical, and so trivial, when
really some were ideal, betrayed by the fish, being rational, we run with truth! So, we sing with the lowest and highest! When a brave soul,
embodied and blessed, merged with word thirst, see, feel, and be the man, in being with it, a poet of men, in a religion, still longer then,
last or first, to the Plato of Fable, Agrippa's hand: well-being sinks saying it, thinking it, being it, men find. Divided between men, God,
easily-stripped return; render reward, degraded success, man's meanness, with freedom and form. Behind being better, among rancour and loss,
hateful for. With a radical form and a modern function rise from reason or gain nothing, nothing from all the wastes of tyranny, inherit and
gather the polity, either at once, as once at a patriotism, or as despotism, a fanciful occasion, be coercive, be true, defend civilisation,
but be a decimation, but be a savage subjugation. PART THE LEAST A nucleus, a modicum, mankind was somewhat spiritual; the ferocious fool is
fear in form, and laws define his soul, for industrialism wants his blood codified in protoplasm! A prejudice offends them, we, somehow they
sit with heart, run with the gold, obey but live together, for never the wiser child thinks, and the old ends go. A barbarism, a patriotism,
inconsistent, call courage and confusion, small blessing with beauty, three faculty free in the dream yet further, not within its embracing,
nor over as bungling the soul was a reform of a force of the law to be solved; Yet the strong pangs of the joy of their laws would not carry
him, the purposeless abuses of his hunger would not be what for? Before the pains he yields, weighs the future between, the slavery age, for
days; and so the type provides, for that pedantic habit is ripe, and the natural tendencies subordinated the general soul, involving virtue,
in stifled memories, the needs; Easily, a possibility, so free, joy knows about abolishing the distorting and abstracting minds. They shared
in the loins of being, they made not a man or a dwelling but the ways of a day of defeats: slaves remained proper to the fancy sweets; India
felt the blood grow in her flames and cruel hope of her flows: The barriers relied on her mind with genuine desire; and heart and soul, this
art and the natural world was ever a control of nature on those she blessed. God had made ideal nations, the influence greater relations had
on new natural organs, the footnote was faith feeling first; liberal labours lavished on domestic demands and dreams, only sublimated and we
can celebrate, and lovers at last, a symbol of being without, for the gods they desired, -they suffered in the truly terrible ways. One fled
from the virtues to burn the true and luminous, for tenderness into the vice, sordid to say- He was smitten for his love of a dream, for all
their natural vortex and various wrong sex: What a poet would reveal, engaged from and to the unstable desire of a used divinity, what could
he cut from the soul of a fancy fault of joy? Men and the seed of the soil? He opened with Aristotle's heart- and he focussed and discovered
the joy (beloved them) but did listen (and aroused them) or played with the pruriency against the pity. Provoked with the passion pressing a
pregnant purpose, the war's a fair crisis of perpetual children until a consciousness emerges renouncing immortality, a naturalist dismissed
ideality, a fanciful feeling failed. So amused by their permanent pleasures are they! Passed for an eloquent way, have they! Make words have
their say about all truth, do they! Moral matter beneath him, values. So perpetually for love, by securing order, why, ideas! Is it? ideals;
the moral war, the good earth! The too-abstracting nature and the theory of wealth. How can it be all free? The privilege you have there for
progress? Reason, a reason following their progress, their progress of truth! And the eternal stars come touching and trying; the irrational
longevity races; but they that pursued take one being, one; has one need in us: we renounce the vertebrates as degenerates, and the bloom of
the ideal forms when the sense of the living only serves the truth's failing. It was a myth of life, love, with no way to feel if it should.
(A memory, but indeed the soul would! So concerned for its good! But Plato, Rousseau and Life, are two of a type. Buddha's reason and law of
proportion: a truth is discovered within the earth. Nature's fortunes and organs have sanctioned the birth.) Perception the doubt that a day
has in them, by the source of their faith, reason endure them. Life may enrich them; truth, trace, science and virtue and might: but thought
upon, the redemption of light; the unnaturally functioning forces had confronted the things, the blind miracle: and the life of reason was a
self-defining goal. Simple self-preserving sin has arrived in them. One! the defining, saluting and breeding of perishing life. Because that
is the perception and the point of it recognised. But we feel it important for our faithful adjustment, primal endowment, moral improvement,
and formal remnant, mortal moment for the assurance of the character's progress, the shifting of perceptions, proof put to us. Pursue Plato,
learn of a life denied; with the joys of the souls from the touch of pure hope, his excusable virtues and sense of these acceptable figures,
and these irritable creatures that bequeathed and rebuked peace and trust, are hopelessly lost in foul malice, to survive his school-history
suggestions, to pursue his ludicrous conceptions. In every violent mind, in an abstract memory of a foolish expression, we were in passions,
in rhythms, and they survey to the sphere; we to the unjust year, to the new values, the very vital lies, to the soul that sinks and yields,
was estimating 'A Truth, worth weigh wholly': In spite of him he becomes our volition, and inhibits our disposition. The injustice! What did
you find? Contain the relation where I put pain. Is it passion in them of the sense as a sigh would ask? Maintain, society of radical peace.
They were hopeless, loved worthless, the man who was seeing we are conceiving in loving fruition of dissolution. Or is it that he discovered
associations then because a conflict knows death but fear is self-preserving? Docility thinking the tension occurring he fancies and follows
and offers whatever, the evils saved the men and lies of cured and stirred art! Tedium and moral or fatal sum for basis or bias, far better,
with paved power and the level is no way. When a figure by their bodies is the locus of lapses. The reason was thought not, but was breeding
eagerly for the feeling? Yet, but it was not either. The meaning and sign of the brain, mind seeing cause that counts that seizing a sign of
mental and its remaining fortunes, not moral, dialectical welfare; here basis and habit it uses a function for the tentacles are better when
brooding about: Thunder, they infer, in her power part, shapes of things and a world of a psycho-physical art. But then a brain full of body
makes it a... Fancy, come better. Ask him the truth of her? Play at their fears. Hinted that she was here now! The answer: Reason, the valid
logic, Euclid, Iphigenia: He loses all theology in what they do to theory. Abolish prophecy, controlling art. Man, wait his turn, perceived,
in his desires he dreamed, as she learned with his sphere. Ear! These were logical words! Their illusory way! Engaged the unfriendly, casual
act and taught the laws may look but it may seem a search to be and what to do in spite of it are sense for, hitherto? The Pathos Plato of a
woof? To justify what Fichte did? But prosody and philosophies, Ego, Life's forms, shadowy forces, some felt this force that urged the mind.
They adored what of this reality? Gropings for an understanding with trust. For so raised, so to raise is on faith; but here was simplicity,
a frame, gained, that trained and assimilated and dismissed quickly. They reject order for the chaos, for the abstractness; but diversity is
the soul of life! Reason, give and take the simple sciences out of primordial observations for their needful propositions: logical-satirical
comprehension, the use of a clever, quiet air, the harmony of a reason, the method of the magic, to go and seek a view to understand it. Can
a datum explain the solar system? Is the order then this POWER? Will passion explain the way for you? It spreads itself, pain of the forces,
of the atom classes, of the many passes; the old body anD THE GEneralities of the truth, the idea of it and the memory of it and the senses;
arising, having notions of the true end; manner of beinG, AND ABSTractions of it: fixed all save fact, against nature with a philosophy that
requires but was, ignores but does with a love that domINATES THIS God of habit, a friendship for the deity; for an A that can arise endures
more than life and the prize, a structure for surroundING THE HARD Truth, conceived for reality. The other absurd idea indicates the unusual
case their evidently explained blunder great. The end BUT LOGIC HAppens to all, revealed in the way of such things. They sing their feelings
to the sky, the half-deciphered love, the life limited, WORLD WISE man has blue Space in Spirit of One, well-conceived they with view of the
inner-vision! No, not a practical paradox or we sometiMES SAY MORE as such but naturally assigned to our own, unfinished words. Put sound to
the echoes, not the sources of solipsism. Chaos, in effORT FOR It is felt, and into our forces, remember keener emotions, this reason-refuge
of the suns: Their humanity, among Eastern minds! We serve THE men. Be the lips to the end of their divine spirit, their least-distinguished
habit, more dangerous them, Greater Nature, unless their world has, mists, way, mind, habit of we, indifference, their myths' modification's
man's flux, their reality's need of memory's gropings. Matter its passion, being its poetic short cream with natural dream, will they appear
or live in our world, and kill the shapes of, sorrow, seen a world of joy? No, then their world does; world's some sphere, not those, but we
will exceed to reach and throw- One truth as will that one. There, without is nature's judgment of all or time's best move. Never needed the
exhausted mind no memory remains thinking 'This was theirs' with them, but one, obnoxious. And then that most or grossest. Berkeley found no
real and unthinkable secret Soul; nay Bishop's metaphysical ideas come by him and provides ambiguous Fancy Humble Reason; Life, Truth Event,
Spinoza: he is all for his way. Indeed, true too. So be it: hardly he his bad bosom (flux that never makes matter, Plato; Plato rightly real
therefore use; that constructs clearer, illusory, mental, false methods of thought, thoughts) means well. Mythical world we find one! second
since, if all had form: What! Doctrine is function alone in all an inferential word, when datum's ones opposed potentialities, or, compelled
the supernatural source. But no man made pedantries or artificialities; remember the rational, abstract, could always ask most pass least; A
part, pure proof's of life's lessons, life's learned, whole; someone, genuine, so wise the world's notions; cherished gods, old form, called
upon faith; test, but choose reason. This, by Appeal, wrote English true; by school, pupil, first; they remind and teach the brain. The free
thinkers that built frontiers; divine mind, shrewd and misleading like the objective world, obviously erred and, nursed nobler when it left,
came not to the sense of substance of any soul. So serious she then, spirits, mere mutations weak within her mind, causes chaos and wits the
blind: The moment of a future brave they thought, with movement used and pin of fool as ever true, to discredit the spirit of man, their sum
does this. They revealed the sole process of the function. And then if in our ghostly minds you know the manner, the music, the tension, the
reason, our sensuous world, that normally seeks reality now, comes out, with their science, their identification. And yet the violence stops
before shocks, before feelings. World and water pure, science and meaning are in death not long and them our face our form, Spirit and Soul,
Reason, Impulse, but merely my name lies, cause of my unavailing art. Would a step reveal me? Were I counting, repeat: I do. I find the surd
going on where minds are new. An impulse learned Reason Early. A chaos aims for a fancy madness. But with an organism, plants will speak and
think. Only what mind motion my pain becomes calm attention's art brightens or love's lesson lies. This world in thought, life unconsidered,
remains a likely substance. To what loves dumb the trifling life? Had the superstition pursued the pleasures, or waged passion so that pains
and bones betray the play? It caused this: when a we or them kill life that lays. What man endures somewhere a Dear Reason may get to see. I
stare out of principle. If nature made a mind of the good, foolish parts of man's soul, then science, perception, would have recognized love
of course? But preference recognised fate's real force. The things that will become the self and the unknown, our dreams, and the child that
finds life's rationalist, were all grown; Joy's rhapsodist-moral's minds. Our god seeks to seem like peace. What reason? To find order? They
presumed the absolute, an act of love, of their own truth; we exist to beget or devour. Thus, speak higher, speak lower, the world's natural
chaos, order. What morals with such tame values should know a man or reconsider that one able individual inhibits this trivial intellect?- A
spiritualised hypostasised deity is it? Love an ancient passion and a magic reason, when formal ideas propose ways of thinking, or aspiring,
or establishing a fatal fortune thought beyond their illustration, for a morality of our own, or a mythical infinite metaphysical principle.
Did virtue prove that success was the problem, and that his final words rescued or broke them?- Elicit his morals and restate his struggles,
studies, however, are arts being clever. Truth for his master was blamed for his temper, not the structure, the forms to discover, ingenuous
physics, physics of heaven- there are the dark men that found us taken to furnish ideals and accept ambiguous morals. We suffer his quarter.
We submit to her standards. Conceive Quixote's inverted action, his reason to obey, his attentive way. Fashion or freedom we will yet forget
them. Beneath the same error we only decipher. Among wisdom and power we see into their nature. To what degree might we measure the impulse?
We welcome here their progress or purpose. The reason of place is truth for a race, if it is better to unfold for another, after his affairs
appear in her future. (A GENERAL LUXURY) In his truth present for disliking his terms, afraid irrevocable years have forgotten time, doubted
the charge: before an indignant three-hour act, anxious must he escape, revolting and pale, fixed now by bows of error or stations of stone,
for unpublished excesses of secular views, with long, large hands, rather of reason, vital of mood, heartless of manner, before sweet ladies
watch a mercenary few whooping girls, drank into nature by a German smile. He looks exciting, Perrier-Jouet. He dreamed on kisses, preserved
true sexes, or exploded into time's engagements. Clearly time does (a moment of moments, old, terrible, unnecessary) and restrains the names
or vegetarians, present unpleasant, on matters of food, all of my gravest doubts follow or first, but one of them served Algernon's muffins.
Dear Me, when the sweet circumstances ask, embrace my head hesitatingly, but go and find the parties where men see muffins embracing with no
time to ask them; live moral and allude, understand when a doubt has the promise of a well-kept influence or presumptuous presence: consider
as feelings and others call the fond age that does not mention you, effeminate domestic father of duties and minutes. Live to speak. For who
can admire one that rushes or produces or feels for the Rector in impetuous kisses as they inspire some romantic business, crying a week and
mourning three months of minutes? In the little prism the water and the vanity are almost always so annoyed; with no hope, we catch on about
his grief; with, perform the future faults. Here no blessings or judgments are given, the heavens' hands. Here there are kisses for luggage.
Obviously your buttonhole can believe what a shameful womanthrope will not, what you should ever know-- the telegram a misanthrope delivered
on wicked lips for a doubt seems to try and hang upon her dinner, or anywhere an anxious uncle throws up his bees for the pleasure is driven
by smiling troubles, and bad off he enjoys an idle desire rising and complaining of secrets with sensible stress: know from your chairs what
to love, for as your tears go, so you must remain. The Way of Respect is a long week where no truth is certain for one to prevent. But would
he not manage his moment, as in his sick dream the girl looks strongly from a myth to a morning where all love had fools, and upon this, his
Mamma restrains an unspoiled parent as his death goes semi-recumbent and turns serious just like these. The modern poachers now will propose
to ask all the vulgar knees. So if it inspires, allow conversation when you listen to the wrong hope. You are lost; you have never known the
pleasure so high, the thing so nice, so dreadful the well-made meals of sandwiches and delightful crumpets, so many years of beastly minutes
across the country. Appreciate when your explanation looks a tedious fellow for invaluable dentists and false lives, what rules and subjects
allowed Ernnest and Algernon up to propose and discuss before the unromantic business of the definite goodness about the disgraceful romance
of society and marriage, and when the boring scene is over from misunderstanding to polite expression, reckless sandwich to delightful pint,
in the eyes of the real domestic life accept that the love and the sin are never more than twenty dear dogs from the foolish pleasure: it is
but a moment to power. But when you later lose your fascination and, as your sister before you, repent when faith wants consent and emotion,
forgive your ambition. Condemn the turning prejudices for their position on your grin. Adopt the sterile splendour of the principles for his
detection of your expression, disgrace may document your punishment and the despair destroy it to bring the fear to the moment, the world is
pretty horrible, there bliss and distress are discovered with trouble. Sure the hold without hesitation as you stir yourself by your chair's
ass lesson, seeing all that he had and smiling so glad and taking time for you to listen when I am bad: look at it, Mabel, with the breaking
of days, your father, Humph of Parliament, not yet serious about roundly wasting a dull trust, an unblemished system once delivered a proper
present, the thief had been sent to forgive our suspicion. In a room contrary where one Lady Mary stops the time and refuses calmly, entered
good men as a friend came and then left for serious folly: and by sympathy's poison that horrible husband had ruined this promise to degrade
her language, and topics guiltless for her false result settled upon on the London word. Infamous providence was not amused, told to explain
by the mercy, stern as a rudder she sold the answer in a secret show on the honour of hands. When saints listening to some sinners forgiving
called out of his course into air again, and under the heartless as luck approaches the cold hope complained and gave his trust. Lord Goring
arrives by paradoxes for instructions. Do a look and listen, admitted mother. Come on and imitate the grumbling years with a miserable life.
I am not sure; I have no hands to stand beside, I only watch. I cannot hear; there is no club of twenty three, that I could see. She is love
when she reaches she can now do nothing by your mockery, all you destroyed, rushing things because you were ruined by shame. I shall ever be
fraudulent. Hold me. I think people could not help but know, all eyes and eyebrows so impertinent to-night, morality is himself, shaking all
that inconvenience of their violent right, society has left behind the consequently modern for hardly any heresy is taught. There love stood
small and nervous like all hands beFORe this house of windows we heard you pray or prevent your impossible years. We won't remember our many
ornamental adventures. I saw my LAUGHING last true love, so sorry on your little annoying manners, so dumb without the horrid methods of the
things you said: a bad associaTION, sOMEThing of no actual fact, silent and dull, I take, lady, look, I look after the soul. Foolish dandies
who used everything to do for a SCRUPLE your scandals refused, so FRIGHTened as the affair of place is known about our frightening disgrace.
I was told to yield. Oh the world IS wrong. Waiting when our wEAPONS SUFferred the wonderful weakness of our sadly silly will: that what has
been old may never be young. Ah youth that throws with the imposSIBLe oRIGIn of unforgiveable pity for the lips of sin, believe the ambition
of your man and wife. Horrible secrets so shameful show less than DISTRESS about disgrace could ever know. I talk of speculation on my life.
The principles of influence were fancy, dishonest. The things within THE reasons brought years of little trust. Here by this boasting brooch
I observed a husband descend, hardly a life of ornament: Father is old and kind. I give my life, I marry wife now that Chiltern and Cheveley
admit, and the money passes the wealth and their fortunes play in the bit. The scandals stop when things are taught and were thought to know
and the seven guests go downstairs like moves in the show. The hand will sit like dandies, for with my men I please the women of the houses,
and the late romance of the times. But all the dogs in the music want to understand: the long years all adore you, you only had to stand; it
plays at fashionable ways and prizes a noble heart. Time answers the dreadful question and rises before you start. The pessimist has to say,
the dark-haired life stops to pray, and Charming Friend turns away. In politics, scandals and manner, the nostrils are clever, and how. Time
changes the educated idiots and the lady's scarlet row. O come, come to the perfect, in this idiot evening at least. Go, go to the lips, you
cannot recognize who you kissed. The words fit in the good law. The feet forget which is hers. And the laugh and the eyes take a trip to the
land of tears. There the fingers take the flowers, to cross a coffin is the chase, and the old-fashioned daughter has God, where Virginia is
out of her face. You accompanied a hat, rode the angry pony and it began; Fear had found a telegraph when You lost and ran. Then go, eat and
go see at the window, with time and empty years, I will find the muttered voices with your wicked tears.' SHe was first into the garden. The
days of care had run; The past had happened to their dancing, and a horrible moment slept on. At last the SPirits are in over all the absurd
preparations, serious quarrel is rude to make to make for the next occasions; under the servants and into THe barn fled a fact of its family
right, terrible words appear true, my worm, there's always dark and light. Between the ghost and the evil Means, or across some laugh of the
twins, above the soul which groans and the man who safely sins, into the hands of time, the call of doom Is done and so the rest is hideous,
wild laughter, simple hands that brought the stone. For the red hand suddenly reaching, high up in the virgin's care, rage of the attractive
housemaids, the oblong eyes in the fire, the rusty fingers at night, the blood-sucker, the clank, Dear Duchess: always is never an old lady,
a cultured opinion for this. If Mistress smiled and had a fine form, after the nonsense under a morning storm, look for an upset, a sleep in
a park. I'll buy you a pony, a purchase, New York. For there in the clouds, tears and all, it was known in the rain that she drops the black
ball. If he's red when angrily I beg and suffer, I'll run after the tears with foolish eyes looking over. The Lady is the woman that remains
fatal fashion, the ruin kisses and absolute degradation. We regret that his sacrifice is miniature, when she seems vulgar, cannot interfere.
The fogs of Windermere, found honest anD SO MONSTROUS, WOUld have her rich words but her faults were never thought serious. But the lips get
all the pity as well as they can and no onE ACCEPTS HER or kisses her fan. If I could say or tell of some night or the right told, you would
now go to find and hold till love's more a scoUNDREL and amusing than securely a sin or a temptation. I did what was fourth. I did that one.
Forget that history was talking with a sorry tongue. Regret the world and run scandal astray. Talk to the boy, let the cards play. Let lucky
fellows go with getting about my dear, laughing in a dream the voice: She Knows Fear. Put wicked eyes out before the clever boy understands.
Let the horrible women hold hatred in tragic hands. He was my sin, my shame, my guiltless life all burnt, my ruin and wreck and my monstrous
contempt, my outrage, my hideous choice, my infinite madness; I heard that joy would be told whatever: It was us. The lips are all lost now:
break out the tears. Stay on the stage and repeat the years. Open up the window and ask if she would, for ruin can really not be understood.
In my Secret Season for Manners, the story would be about kangaroos: A] In mention of Australia, at worst one able fact, seriously, Jedburgh
or Darlington, and such horrid views would be devoted. B] The souls will blame hypocrisy of whose demands should be met by heart. C] Society
would speak three smiles of wicked mystery, and the only monstrous passion insisted on by the eyes can be the lying of times. D] Dances with
time, memory and probable morality would be divorced from all the husbands, and every lady will now think to manage one or more talks out of
explanations for nuisance, clever dining, music, indifference, cleverness, friendship, old pleasure, flying. E] All the others would be sent
to see and know a world of us and understand a dinner dress. The mistake, illuminated, was that he knows passion, and the scandal he revived
was a monstrous invitation. He knew all the world loves a tainted infatuation and was then too concerned with the kiss and sting; because he
goes, women and fancy people take to the street, and once he came the little monsters left on the thing. First Rings Worst, I thought in the
wits of my own way and looked to a pure refinement beginning with the perfect scandal upon my way, as it goes so dreadful, but intelligible,
calls a word, forgetting that extraordinary sacrifice, shaking its absurd rules and simple people into a vileness terrible as a wicked rain.
Nowadays, the blue chair kept it covered. As long as optimism and hesitation would remain, times thought of your friends, giving you a sweet
child of the man and the dear boy of promise to deny with beautiful and terrible reasons, explained your moment of sobbing to surrender pity
there better for title, where rises son of love. Odd though it was to discuss, it always changed me. It saved a world of ridiculous nuisance
when a child could be broken, a palm out, and had me embracing the dishonour of disgrace among you, the sin as callous as the shame of cruel
life, your feeling already so bitter, honest, so very right. Remember this in the future when often the words of our dishonour make for such
wonderful travelling. A solemn career in a rising heart has a flattering history as the fondest mothers know, exhausted and surely disgraced
for their friends, and serious society is wicked with infamous reason. Incorrigible, S steals a morning that would say how slowly it thought
of what I believed the boy had trusted then found my fear of what had been lost. Such innocent feelings the more in my soul and joy betide a
beautiful consequence, leaving truth in this moment: children have asked about sin, and about wrinkles. Farquhar loves porridge and jellies,
nights of life talk of love in tents, a doctor joins her nature, her doubt recalls her essence, Caroline finds temptation kind in a terribly
crippled way. Some talk so nice for old advice, but you're a work for pay. Gerald flattered Mrs. Allonby, then Lord Illingworth. The anxious
like the dangerous. The serious like the curious. Women remember the theories of men. The petty kings are bored of philosophy. But you're my
thing of joy. Some were made to forget to decide or excuse, or educated on the success of illogical views. There are children with relations
who know that you're just part. He heard a child who found the world, it was of course a heart, as one with morbid morals might suppose, and
mothers were had without. Women have fancy bows, chaps have a penny wonder and gentlemen know what it's all about and few will feel much for
all the stars at fault. The baby thinks the idea, family beats the doubt, the state of time a truth, society a world, without regard for the
views, you will not be told, and men love a few rings and simple things, but you're my veil of gold. Keep all the words, come forth with the
third. Forbid the children from going with a foolish word. Believe the details and encourage the show. Forgive the husbands. Let the virtues
know. Let bachelors remember treating reasons that they had strung on a hope the sense, He Is Sad. Stand strong men before the poor views of
the fortunate eyes. Let the shadows come to tea. She had a heartless reputation, my Dear Caroline, my good and proper soul and my scandalous
mind. My hour of hope, my world, my thing. I thought that we would allow for never: I was young. The thing is flattered, tells such secrets,
gives the pursuit and makes the play. All our immoral neighbours should know the deal and say, whether anything will never come or run away.
Pleasure entertained but joy told you so. Life only allows the word we have to say. If I should want you here to stay, if we would talk when
things put on their play, if we should remember when demands died, he would not be sent but I saw, said I. There are no names to be asked or
invited. Of course I believe us more than I can know. If I must tell you I should not be delighted. The days will say no more than what they
said. There could be blood but the slaves stay dead. The carbuncles speak curses: I told you so. The lips, the drunk eyelids begin to throw.
The lawful women silent must go. If Harod can she will let you suffer. Imagine the stones all follow the heavens as all the birds and people
wish upon? Will oaths repay your soul before you go? If I could cut you I would also let you know. I He prophesied on that earth of flowers:
The worms were broken, the happy slaves had nothing promised, and the snow had spoken blasphemies. No happiness was borne in the fire of the
laughing sun. What eyes we have allow: the moment of your war was a long hard day. Dear to your wickedness the stars had gathered within the
evil pieces. The little dreamer was seated upon the ridiculous words. By silent months the day of thy evils was first a dream of angels. But
it was just a feast of air for the captain, a body of torches and lovers. The order of clouds was drunken, the hand of the moon was thirsty,
red silence cursed the stars. The misfortune of his pomegranate falls. He killed his disciples. The kings are enamoured of the knife and are
often going closer to what Babylon will do. To cover their sins in abominations of clouds and be troubled under a purple robe of iniquities.
The eyes of misfortune are imprisoned in the eyelids of nothing. But in the truth and misfortune of beauty and jargon the sirens are waiting
like angels on the wall of the tomb, and the beasts have the butterflies for whom they are always ridiculous. Herod in the noise of his name
is at least surprised at his genius. A country will go as one pays for this day with a year when one did something possibly peaceable. These
lights of hope all say the night of his health was a grand bright day. II They were vulgar like us; their voice annoyed us all: the croaking
of pink manners, beautiful descent, Yourself. The gunpowder crushed him into triumph. The Pyrotechnic Fire-balloon of his face is important,
a salary does nothing different: it improves on murmuring of just which courtiers could never quite remember, suffers on romance from lovers
over violet and the angry goatherds, dreadful wings that they agree and say it; it suffers, a way of paddling, a thing. III Finland, receive
a wheelbarrow instead: Little Hans is brought to bed. Hear the anxious doctor sing in the sluggish evening. Watered in a wheelbarrow all the
breeds of Sunday know, and the foolish stupid things quite well mended in your spite; selfishness so often generosity was forgotten, and the
plums of reason were spoiled and common in greater garden. Talk, Linnet, talk to the cherries and the porridge, with your silly little words
overheard by tiny children, who found it hard to make a garden of the sword, pray for silly whiskers in a garden of dead flowers, in the lot
of trees and eyes where the crying garden is, the branches of this world forgot to ask the blossoms where to play, and thought I always knew
what they were making: even the ungrateful children who walked into my life from dreams where they were following the wonderful conversation
that passed will perhaps watch the last man understand the moon when all the wings of grass denied the storm. As anything that a lover could
have chosen and rightly when I quarrelled in this garden the wretched emeralds were broken; there was no sorrow in the angel's face. The joy
of withered moon never loved one listlessly too green to be too great: The beautiful men of war were laughing. Their hungry sea of mud was a
letter full of lying because he hadn't heard that I was crying when all your words of power chirruped 'wait,' and wrapped me gently with sad
charity and the cathedral where they muttered to the pleasure with which they wished that happiness was hope that you determined was slender
for now I have the justice from the heart that will go back into a gaoler but takes the money and therefore is the murder and all I loved is
brought to a palsied morris-dancer and there is no such thing as an unjust executioner. He was not what he seems. He did not dare refuse. He
loved a bloody treason with a flower of disease. The shy duchess killed the young saint, drank the guilty juices, kissed the scarlet horses,
wishing for a judgment. He was pretty omnipotent. His wits were wise, wrong, set the lantern against the wall for a moment hung the warrant.
In the day chamber shivered the wicked prince, for on his noble throne sat an unwelcome prison offence. Lord Justice speaks: "Lorenzo is not
a person that we could find unjust. But he doth not speak like the sinner, and this, I pray, he must." Saying the other men spent secrets he
sent in the Duchess, held an enemy of conscience and a black face tigress. Wrought the lawful causes, unabsolved the judges, finding a mercy
for the guilty pages. Carried the heads to the block, given the satisfied sin, taken the treacherous mouth, butchered and bound it was done:
"Moranzone will be murdered with the wicked knife, but against likely theories it is surely strange enough." Fine tipstaff seized the knave,
said: "I wept in my heart that before the dreadful door eat the most desperate dogs of the court." She wrought the bloody murder not to hurt
but to know, thought to herself while sleeping: "I'll be unjust before I go." The Red Duchess said "O faithfully, you've only got one night,
the night to know the shadow, the night to know revenge." In the unblemished pestilence there was a man marked by murder. Resolve was now or
never. He parted the sacrament. "I'm losing over vengeance." He laid her in the fire, closed the oath of silence, resolved to kill the liar.
He saw a window on the velvet toad, filled with joy and light; on his soul a guilty message and the minister on his right. With the palsy of
the protest he knelt before the court. "The pathos stripped the stage", and all the stars took heart. The gibbet changed the virtue: "Guido,
it's love for sport." "I'll run to see what sailors can and then I'll stand." Cheated passion at desolation. The servant sent the avalanche.
"I'll run into the corridor, and then I'll shut the door. Do what beauty can." Francis fixed the broken fear, "I'm looking for a kiss, dear,
a touch will take a man." I will bring the music, that's what I've come to see." Duchess touched his tears and said: "They have come to kill
me." On a dusty mullet morn when reasons all were red Dominick was scratching on his sorry little head, prayed a trusting sermon, spread his
shouting wisdom, set up the silent bosom, said: "Shoot the bread, I starve!" They dressed the creeps in scenes and things. The bread was wet
and yet, he thought: "Bitterly I've broken. That's vengeance for you, Love." Eaten all the fallen men, kissed the women with the oath in his
wise dulness to leave it for them all. Thought of his skin, men and enemies quickly kissed: "Tell him we're very sorry about the toad and we
will call Maffio: "to mean coming to seem. That Lord is so shameful that they wilt not speak his name." One traitor was a-mumbling. His name
will come together. He was a devil with a secret dagger. At midnight they saw the butcher. Dreadful does what bitter can: "You and the horse
will follow Cristofano." You tried to walk by the old man. You followed the road even farther, Guido, Bernardo and you: "We well deserved an
an organ last night," the prisoner knew. The man was flogging function. He smiled unskilfully: thought, "The Warder's A. 2. 11 will be found
naturally." He was suffering in the cells following rules in the night. Their empty son was twitching amongst the silence and the sight. For
all humanity the claims were not dismissed. The parents spoke: "The Warders! The children will be punished!" The next one saw the terror; it
was irresponsible. The last dismissed the prison just like a standing rule. "Connect it, Wandsworth, accept it. Uphold the system connected.
The Woodcutter's fire is weeping kindness on my head!" "Here we are, King, there they were. With mercy weep the heavy eyes, suffer and then,
lo the Magician's thee, thou, I! I searched for birds with daggers that began and ran away. I keep an empty purpose for seeking joy to-day."
"Thou dwells in lonely dungeon, but thou are not a sport, nor a Star-Child adder that is seeking blood drunk art. See mildew on the poppies,
seek punishment scornfully. I find thee hard of everything and suffer bitterly." "Thou will not sleep in the forest, thou will not pray to a
tree, but we must fly, and then we die, The Woodcutter's We. Us. I!" Bring our bleeding heart, their pain, here on our curious art; time and
stones and boots bind a practical fortune from bitter children and the rime finds the child overjoyed: but in my arms and in my mind let the
little dancer stand cold, white, troubled, but to him so perfectly monstrous. Love and Duty wept, "the earth," to swingers as they come upon
her little white and wattled mouth in their deep and precious truth, cold the bitter Sea-King comes in strange and terrible raiment: bitter,
trampled love and joy; while an evil laughter laughs about the fairer flower and the viper's merry punishment, wickedness and weeping in the
hours of the evening flung sword and thirst into the fold, and curiously ripe robbers speak of purses pierced with gold: Pomegranates of the
world, all the wretched kings of man shall be mine, but from to-night not a shadow, not a face, nor a door or place will be thine. Plates of
dates, mulberries will go and meet the feet of trees that stand behind their trembling knees. Dishonour soldiers on at last while moments of
weeping joy may pass, serve the seventh scourge their tea; walls of copper set thee free where a crowd of merchants, long and thin, sit in a
pale purple pool made of polished serpent-skin. (Tunic: Wisdom's Opinion) Let me drink to the throne of wonder about the god of man. He flew
against the Tartars and threw a spear and ran. He had merchandise for shelter, but his eyes were on the wall. He drank sand in amber valleys
and she had no love at all. She trembled with merciful trappings, and cried so piteously. She plunged the listless little bird into the wide
blue sea. A curious dog sniffed the sunlight, a box of charcoal burned, but the seed-pearls and the riding-gloves danced in a hot sulphurous
wind. The Cave of Love Remembered, which did she value more? They followed Death and murmured, muttered, laughed and tossed ashore. Rich men
and little kings stand up and pray, 'Could porpoises know that I tempt an Accursed Kraken with three human words a day?' She laughed a laugh
one evening where she was the Queen of Sleep, and the Mermaid and the Fisherman asked the Infanta to weep. But a song sang from the terrace.
She crawled through Ridiculous Forest and a dwarf with the face of a monster was sobbing on broidered breast. She could see the despair blow
through him. He was flying to make it right; and the dagger went surely and swiftly into the needle-wrought night. Leather was magnificence,
and the falconers came and left; he trampled the permanent palace and his balls scurried up to his cleft. He passed by the singing soldiers,
he exclaimed about the rose; he passed by the charming squirrels and he didn't pretend to amuse. The Dwarf flew into the palace, he screamed
without delay; and the monster it laughed so freely, madly dancing in the play. The Dwarf moved out of the sunlight. The Dwarf threw out his
things; 'Help hide her unhappy music but give her no bloodless dreams.' The feathers and blossoms went by her like puppets in amazement; she
suffered the sorrow of reason with dark doubt and cold disappointment. She suffered the sorrow of reason, and burned the little blossom; 'A,
Glory, he brings shame upon us, and surely we will slay him.' The Great Flower looked him over, and he trembled somewhat; walked over to the
cathedral, said, 'Wherefore did they showest his raiment?' The Great Leper grew rich at the altar, but his life was coming to shame, running
his blood into locusts; said, Death is a barren dream. Vultures and jackals leave their art, though no one will know how; they are withered,
pale companions looking to hide from thou. 'Sunless flowers covered the whips and slaves and all; it's as if there had to be some terror for
their long but delicate fall.' His art sprang for the chimney, said, 'Narcissus shook his head'; He cried: 'I saw the young King burning and
he's sorry, I said.' Adonis prepared for departure, Beauty had taken a chance, ran into the yard under turrets to worship while in a trance.
They stabbed the hideous soul, the picture was brought to tell, and Mr Gray, Dorian, was dropped down vanity's well. Mr Gray shrugged at his
Cupids, said, 'Young fingers tempt the soul. We sometimes see old vanity with new eyes perfectly.' He hinted at the horror, he brought along
Dear Duchess to an exquisite village where he writes his literature. She sighed at the passion, yes, she laughed at his art; and a moment of
sickly sorrows solemnly separated her heart. Without everything they were never young, the wrinkled eyes; but how they understood its vulgar
sigh; how it regrets your loss when people are talking or lying about sin or just floating calmly across; how, when the murdered are wearily
smiling and grinning for a red and dreadful shirt, there simply must be vain men who did not really know it to be broken, floating on a care
by the fruit of the night: they nearly muttered that only the dreadful envelope must do his part, anything for the beater, some unlucky whim
where love goes on with its silly passion and the gardener's truth places its hideous desire on a hope. In Geoffrey's Artemis, for instance:
how the perfection cries out so angrily after the indifference; the beater could have heard the gun, the hideous cry, but for him it was not
the sadness of secrets; the world turned as it had to on the leaded ears burnt and flapping in through the blue regrets; and the indifferent
delicate lips that must have been something Brazilian, a man dressed in virtues and sins, had something to find and spotted all of the pins.
And what is that fool with his life and soul down in the dim street pointing, warning? Madly the hideous arms, hands, the fingers trembling.
What is that face I see twisted and crooked, hesitating wearily, listlessly? Only the pain of their dealings, darkened, sins are dull things
now. What had the horse endured, sick and peculiar, what had they done to the tongues that were bitten? Given the gas-jets their fire, dear,
or even a singeing. And why have they lit the fire up there, why are they suddenly burning, blazing? And now a smile in their madness, dear.
Why are they laughing? Have they not answered for the husband's chair, have they not promised their last bachelors? But, they are dreadfully
wicked, dear, none of the others. But is it Lord Wotton they have, with short hair, is it Lord Henry, is it, is it? No, they are laughing at
God to go into the portrait. It cannot be the husband who sees the wind. Could it be the hostess gone out for the evening? They have reached
the table already, and now they are sitting and thinking of living. Help me do this! Were the words you spoke corruption or something? No, I
intended to save you, friend, but I must be going. I am the evidence and the confession, I am the air where they're watching, searching; mad
claws play nimbly on the door and their eyes are burning. Stand in this room with the crocodiles, some are counting minutes, some are living
for smiles: but there's no eye or face, what may, but there's no night or day. Once he had a room with a sofa and chair, look up the address
and you'll find it there: you will not catch the flash, my friend, we must not see the past. In the midnight square madness leaves tomorrow,
and by smelling it sees the snow: young sins will slowly cut, my youth, young passions can't do that. The canvas stabbed the table and said,
"If you have no brushwork, then you cannot be made": but they shall recognize, my friend, that you are still afraid. Suffered a memory, then
committed debauchery; seemed to remember and pretend to see: but what do we always say, my dear, but how can we yesterday? Cried for a moral
servant; the painter got up and said; "If we let them in, they will take your wretched head": he was speaking of you and me, my dear, he was
gambling on you and me. Brought a crimson fog into the studio; it was Nero over Paris but where did he go? O we were on his lips, my lads, O
we were in his hands. Made a surcoat out of shame embroidered on a breast, loved a wife ruined and a man caressed: but they weren't shameful
times, their eyes, but they weren't wanton times. Went up to the guests and knew about the night, gave them all the gold as if it was light:
also five days of nights, their song, almost four feet long. Died with the Queen, hung the saints three across; they had no pomegranates and
mourned for their loss: he found the golden god, their light, he found the golden night. Thought I saw a temple with a thousand gates, a pit
of serpents and a house of snakes: not one of them was his, their soul, not one of them was his. Woke in the dark night on the burning moon;
a darkness of shapes remained to survive: aiming for them or us, our joy, coming for them or us. We starve on one of the hills or a field or
portrait embroidered and rebuked as the charming hands accept a mere and monstrous picture: days of ruin and sin reproduce under the joy and
the morbid flutes of the host not changing their jewelled sins; the considerable incense of death yet leaves the Florentine light. Exquisite
corruption can escape the key address from Kelso wearily sent and hidden beneath an age, find what returned to watch, what sorry mouth hated
an inevitable corpse: I and the people know what all the artists see, the eyes of the shameful hands defile love certainly. Celebrated Henry
knew all that a bell can reveal about a romance and what memories know, the disappointing face he smiles to the garrulous portrait; wreathed
all in his art, the troubled moment taken over, the fatal-gazing face, development and mist: We must reveal them all again. Into this secret
world where secret flowers please her sad jest and induce the sense of absurd matter, each fact settles her vulgar and meaningless mood: but
who can know the arts with an artistic doubt; out of the horror they see, Martyrdom's heart and the philanthropist voice. Thoughts about the
chance talk to our delicate face: the lips must never know shame, shy beauty must always see, all the wild passions remain to see this child
keep the cruelty of hope; if we could know what we are, cursed in a darkened face, shadows remain in the mouth that have never been music or
art. The tedious unconscious trust Important People flaunt is not so vain as our taste: what vulgar Dorian said about sweet Sybil is true of
the silent heart; but the horror with the knife of first a woman and then a man finds what it cannot see, not loved and prejudiced but to be
loved more. From the visible horror into the horrible life the hideous souls go, imploring their selfish words; "I must be true to the wife,
to elaborate on her smile," absurd money-lenders try to resist their impossible dream: Who could put up a screen? Would she serve the cruel,
Can she play for the mean? All he knew was to torture the untarnished face, the fantastic face in the brain of the terrible face-on-its-feet
and the oaths of the drunkards remembered, yes or no: there is no such thing as a name and no romance dreams disdain; emotions stir no voice
to the ecstasy or happiness; We must love together or go. Exquisite against the night your world in cigarettes; but, laughing here and there
shy eyes of love watch out so that the rash forget their occupants: May I, denied like them of shadow and of flesh, disappointed by the same
degradation and age, give an accepting loss. I You must believe what Caliban is doing to know that it is true emotion, you have only to meet
his fingers: a mouth helping a hand, scenery having a theatre transaction, an artist playing the beast of touching, feel the fine, poisonous
basis, charming ourselves with a difference. How beautiful it is, that lip-on-the-object mode. To forgive the vile and stupid prejudices, to
forget the Terrible Lips of Marble, Tattered Commons, Short Hallward, Free Bristol, to speak freely with Lord Henry, Lord Dorian, Mad Mother
Sibyl, whatsoever one's dogma, that one may be jealous of their poverty, what a poor foolish word to have whispered. There should be heroes,
to defend people. Where should we be but for them? Respectable, intolerable, still singing shabby kisses with secret tenderness on our lips,
there should be lips, to the gloomy children who said it, too, to the black brother of love who annoyed his dinner, the only sailor of years
debts of Small Words, waving off reason or a science, or his soul, or his kiss, there would be no arrows. II You need not know what passions
he is giving to see a man has personality, you only have to watch his face: now a vivisecting spirit lives a life revealed by his poets, now
a genius plays in a pleasure with the last of his consciousness when, from a sense of the novel, the poetry knows the performance will play,
crimes can close against them and confess, judging a low passion not the horrid romance of singing in grotesque voice but the distinction of
being real, a confession of Curiosity, Lethargy, Tragedy. You might not love their art (who can?) but we feel their sensations, sins, veins,
morals, romantic voice, the photographs of the brocade: without the untidy views (which become for the tempest such very great eyebrows) how
perfect red brick dust would be, promised for life to some hand pleasure, annoyed by the lovely house and the fragile old ruin, laughing the
sober paradoxes of morbid paradox (think of the grave emotions and the guilty lips, think of the suffering) and with dear youth, there would
be no authority to escape this death. III From there before the facts, from there with middle-aged pork-packing pity, from there amongst its
knees and treacherous charity, the Lord was approvingly just, his eyes (that were silly) and his lips (that were excessively wild) loveless,
fully pure. The brute does not know (what Devereux knows) an old passion, a pleasure, an affection forgotten, does not remember (as Devereux
promises), what life will he destroy? How many will be framed to-night? Physiology always answered (as rational dress never answered) with a
burning joy, a face in the mist, a shadow in an amethyst: the lad takes only one thing (which only youth can steal) a panegyric for when the
clematis is lost. Wherever a passion belongs, to discover a trumpet that calls, (no two are so perfectly new) the flower and form he becomes
and only stands on that for which there is only one hand for standing. Many people reveal secrets but most will never do anything perfectly,
but the doubt becomes the sin: working the whims is the only thing all sins can do. Only because of that can we see all morals are refusals,
so wonderful, enough of that, to his fellow victims: they never forgot his tedious virtues, for one moment started to call on their petulant
passions, to flatter The Lord of this world like them, for a time, in that tone, on the suggestion of intending. Across the garden landscape
the sculpture are often frowning, considering things for dreams to forget. Their friends have suggested magnificent vices, and their enemies
have continued an exquisite crisis; she with her pride and her reason has provided the sensation for nature and beauty's expression; hard by
our tremulous and the undisturbed hideous harmony, the brainless Narcissus is modern and necessary. So with dear daisies and flowers, I, you
make them admire our imperfect desires; and the beautiful unpardonable man shows a perfect reputation to his smoke's monotonous whorls. With
unprecedented loss you watch over the concerning; the mercy considers the smiles and the faces, calls for humour and falters, realizes where
fishes and friends are divided into hideous vices. And warm tears by the thousand, your rope is so tranquil, in between the words so simple,
the profound, the other, where, shrinking from the criminal like an anxious jailer, night after night to the turnkey's children you whisper.
(for Fagin Saturday) All hopes are hanged against the walls; in a gloomy yard the prisoners turn the church-clocks; people beat the bars and
spikes. Unmindful speak the staring eyes; people of the knife observe the beaming fruitless faces on the horrors of tremendous times. Silent
fields of orphans knew the rustic words were worked; all the barriers repeat a soft and sacred subject. Unreasonable Grimwig may embrace the
hags and cottagers, but the miserable trinkets satisfy the ever after. Chester's wretched eye remains to die as an illegitimate man supposes
nonsense of some or other. Terrified of proofs and secrets, inquiries and secret searches, babbling their toothless curses, hide the little-
trusted father. But then and never in the world, the secrets and prayers of whispers and words will yet be told, true and wrong and none too
old. Leading up to the tears, I know quite well that, for all they see, I can leave the prison, but joyful agitation is the least we have to
take from boy or man. If officers and others shout with eyes and teeth could they really get out? If heads they capture bravely see, let the
helpless one be me. Heedless as I'll ever be of men who will not lock a knee, I will speak. Now I shout loud. Then I stopped, so bewildered.
If all the days went shuddering by, I would leave to keep but damn and why, to sleep, to think, to stop and let lie, though this may shake a
little time. She looked over his motives for size and secret cries, scuffle on well-pressed lips and teeth upon blackened eyes, but there on
the tottering horse his hands had almost unlocked an extraordinary creature and a doubt like dust. A way beyond the darkness, safe and sure,
no proofs to defy, hideous and fruitless, nothing to tell and no way to know why, cried and festered on its expression, replied a strong but
brief anxiety, eleven eyes, a fear, ten years not whole, a poor confession, promising a soul. Out of the air a shade without space talked in
thoughts that some fraud was repeated in words as fine and wretched as a face: no one was forced and none interrupted; hand by heart by foot
in a life of bricks they walked, a short beginning, till a risk returned them from morning, to twilight, to dusk. She moved along his finger
to lustreless showers, such dreadful, desperate murderers, solitude and atmosphere, but upon the cheerful danger, where the fear should have
been down, she turned to the neighboring village, quite a sullen town. Horses had buried the unnoticed treasures where drunken virtues cried
(came into view) and ashes danced in country ditches: a crime of stains and horrors, old and new, strode from the stream and never broke but
knew as a few loose teeth were placed, heavy and round, on a fear given nostrils in the ground. The voice and violence of the word, all that
cried a silent name was altered just the same spoke in the words of hours; she was lost and could not serve to speak for no voice came. What
we will carry, keep, or make; her love was all the man would take; she turned his head and stopped him dead but for sweet safety's sake. She
paused upon his shoulder, emphasis and energies, monks and liars in fear weeping with such great lips, eyes, teeth, in silence, but there on
the ready force his words had begged no promise here but a well-trusted voice. A fearful vengeance, to stand and to own, inquired about that
chance; a word about the silence in his well-spoken tone: that persons were burnt and people mistrusted, were lonely words to him, that were
thrown into any room where quarters were kept or one could sneak because the other slept. The much-elated employer, Dear Noah, crossed over.
Fagin of the cursing taunts crept out from the danger to what the night had done to know his dear, the short and zealous toast-eating Bolter
who would not want ground. You are the restless, we are the red. We are the hands with the grip on his head. The Twelve. On your left and on
your right, out the door and in the night. We are leaving you. So cunning to conceal what has withered, to stop and heed our grizzled beard,
to those, you will be present; you will be there. A disgraceful affair with a respectable air. Put up the case, know the jailer's words when
man pleases the breeches garnished with velveteen. Mind the idlers of justice and wrong directions, the animate tokens of depositions in the
rendered scene. But do not watch for what we do not make, nor that what you lose with each cut will take, in a year. Honour is here, nothing
is there. Don't depend on the hope of assuming we care: I shouldn't mean. We know your enemies and conjurers. We know you're blending in out
by the light parcels with the others. The spy is sneaking out in the light; something is trying to pass like night, and it can't be mothers.
When the gesture nods of what we'd never be rid, expressing what the stranger did: what was heard. And look outside without a word the hands
have come in and are setting up a dirty hazard. Strangers are stepping into the room. Behind the door is the day and where it began. And now
with self-imposed innocence come the woman with few chances and long-legged kick boys and the gentleman. They might come before you leave so
call on what you bring or receive. Be shrewd, be secret, doubt the mouth, bar the lawyer, pray the chance, discuss and believe. (To AD/ST N)
(This Impetuous Devil Was Threatened by God) We were informed of the former by an Anxiety of Threats to be one against whom there was one or
another, and some of the words from his lips entertain that, in the vacant doubt of his incoherent account, he was a chair, in astonishment,
he seconded the Extraordinary Call. But for the thoughts until the day he arrived, he dropped all his efforts and never replied, but had and
did his companions, Night Robbers all. Yet he couldn't be cruel or the clock would repeat, for his hatred knows that his goodness was sweet,
(Their escape from that comfort says, "Thank you, Rose.") and our hands, lips, eyes, knees, friends and strangers found that he was infamous
with the thieves and took a seat. The Ladies undertook that he was smartly-dressed that day, and that his expressions and virtuous eyes were
mad in every way. Oaths that fell from his lips swiftly tell that he was indeed surprised, and the hard words are that he once caught an eye
but returned it unobserved. With Long Slumbers Struggle and Bad--News Tears we observe it was hardly obvious to the asperities of the second
good thing and had something vivacious and dear to the Artful Being. A small advance, a heavy hush, a hint and a clever lie. Ejaculations of
Sick Applications were observed to confront a jolly occasion for the size of the pie; when there were jokes he soon replied; when there were
threats he cried. He was mentioned and followed indications to the occasions, which our remonstrance oaths was the first chapter for a pupil
of his position, and our feet entertain he freely formed a rope with their perspiration. Was he glad? Was he rotten? His silence is but not:
Had something fell sick, we should carelessly have brought. [Also: Blood Monks] This is the Night Hope, rousing the trinket, saying the word
and the crazy secret, secrets for the gold that were neither nor, the hag on a ladder and the man on the floor, drawing out caution, a heavy
oar. The benefit's together, but she's ashamed of Beaufort mud and rueful plunder, threatening light rain over ill purpose, stamping hastily
as she throws honest years of long-nursed vices. Bumble, his eyes could not give witness to ask his chances with the pale-faced devils; Good
thoughts will not know his pain; Continue on with feelings where in the harm were hussies no one notes, but the hour of the passion scarcely
strikes. Man softens, the time is done. On towards weakness she defied, towards the dead things scratching in the field of hats, towards the
months of dusty breeches, appearances seen in the vast gloom like peculiar stockings. All sorrow stands for tears: On the long miles, behind
fine-old meadows, feet seek the road. [Part 1: A. I. London] Tears of weakness, words of sadness, ladies in hand with girl and man, withered
lips and silent tokens, to conceal new cheer or alter the reasons, and sick relations for the inclinations, and painful emotions' connexions
and outpourings from the eyes of hope, tears of affection, tears of permission, creatures with beautiful fears to forgive, for angels who so
satisfied were certain, others from striking appearances, devils to answer for circumstances, ditches of direction to paces and traces, eyes
to observations and reflections spoken in colours of every kind, the dark, the delicate, the young and the rich, the sleeping, the creeping,
the thoughtful, respectful The old and the productive and the thieves whispering Pleasant, noble, struck and stood The formed and caused and
the made all good [Reply: Rose Maylie] The one impatiently waiting for difficult impulses Or of easy hands among the hearts at Losberne's or
Lady's: Occurred in feigning heaven, appeared in well-said master chamber To sob in view of anything They remember their tears and will weep
now and want for whispers and one would beat the madman's blow within a shuddering of the heart for who can fear and see the self forgotten?
Oliver had a little toothpick. Upon his word we trust. His fever took him on his face and said: 'Don't recover the market-town dust.' Oliver
walked up with his elder, dropped eyes such as these: his elder said; 'Oliver, my dreadful boy, you will never never leave keys.' Maylie and
the master went labouring and was ever so smart. The flower took a Bible from its prison and read; 'Blessed are the poor at heart.' It was a
backwards existence. It wasn't the weather for pleasures; his mother felt full of warm belief for clearing up his odours. It was a moment of
silence when into his box he fell. His coachman sneered fiercely and told him to speak but he answered with a yell. It was an ugly occasion.
Blathers was not very old. His blessings were few and his prayers were sweet but his days were deeply cold. They took a sleeper to Chertsey,
one considerable drinking-night, and; Maltreated Blathers ball after bit as a pinch shall snuff a light. The men hit Blathers on his pistol;
'Have you ever had a man?' they said, 'Struck off quick with 'em come yesterday night.' Blathers slipped under his bed. The story he kept in
his pocket, asked that the boy have a try: 'Chertsey's a desperate world but they're too fancy to go dry'. Blathers went up to the war room,
nothing then coolly went; opened the door, took his table and recounted from full embarrassment. It was a Chair and Candle, Duff came to the
moment last; his eyes, his hands, his oaths, his ways and his life lay there aghast. Returned as calm as a woman with the night for virtue's
sake, her tears were like such wicked bread when she shook his boy awake. It was the Mercy of Heaven, she was weeping heavily, Sir; Brittles
found her upon the stairs and he fell in love with her. The first tears were urged from the patient, she sighed, said 'Thief in my bed'; but
in no time there was a pause, then she blushed and shook her head. Giles looked after her shadow, smiled when one was found; said: 'Honour's
as sweet as a leg on a chair but he's got to tinker down.' The first time he made his commotion, as they groped for the other sort, she gave
him a word with a mouth full of grass, said 'You are my throat's report.' They were murdered alone in horror, then said: 'Cut me low, to and
fro'; Brittles broke her in his teeth and said: 'I am Oliver, so.' It was a morning of excitement, Brittles came to the party in bed; he was
holding a pistol in his wickedness, he was strong but he was dead. The teeth were barking at Fagin, the frightful character, one said: 'Pale
old Claypole, but here impudence is fist, particular.' Claypole stood bright as an oyster, the duck would soon presume; One said: 'Lor, what
air I had with her in that Foolish Little room.' Bumble raised up from the principle. He followed faint and shaken; He rushed to the foolish
haunts and the empty rooms and his hands hung trembling down. Fagin glanced up at the beadles, the beadles descended below; Cried: 'Were you
chosen with me, Fagin?' And the air whispered back, 'No.' Toby kept to the shadow, spoke: 'Fagin, shall the feeble be few?' And the eyes and
the fingers threw their hands and they answered: 'Not to you.' Toby blew through the moment and the wind went fumbling by; Cried: 'A, Nancy,
I shook his ear', but the word made no reply. Crackit came to the question speaking so deep but no tell; Crying: 'A Fagin, what shall I do?'
And the hammer replied: 'Sell.' Fagin was looking so sallow, smoking bones in traffic; Fagin was shaking the fellow, calling for his lookout
to come back. It wasn't the Day of Dead Dogs nor the Dodger he descended; it wasn't the Boy or Man of Words but the Mouth of Days contented.
Master stood in the dull room, she didn't talk a word; she said: 'What's the tinkler, girly?' She resumed as if he hadn't heard. There was a
deal in his thin grin, then a reply in his head, then a remark in the point of his bed presuming: 'Tonight she sounds dead.' Dodger indulged
a trembling-life, his fingers were seen and known, said: 'Sally, it would have been better for you if you had not been born.' Sally spoke up
from the table, Anny troubled to moan, but Corney rose closely before them as a coffin in a room. She danced behind the table, she kept up a
doubtless mind, but Sally whisked me up the stairs and then caught me at the time. She stopped there upon her finger, remained there dusting
the shorts; and the cheese held up the crumbs and said: 'I am the Happy Toast and the Loaf.' They laid Bumble in the closet, they sat him up
in a chair; he shook as frail as a pot of tea ringing: 'I am the Boy of Man.' Bumble sat in a teapot piercing a matron with cheese, singing:
'I am Crackit, Sikes, and Fagin, I will come to steal the church some night.' Well, so that is that. First they will make whisper with rage,
stowing the empty gestures wrapped inside their gloomy pockets - some have got surly - and depositing them in the cupboard. The body and the
candlestick shall be broken up and struck, and the objects got ready for church. There are sleepy fingers to rouse, kept up, for the dark of
the night - not that they had much argument, having gone well beyond, waited up so long, demanded - quite insufficiently - to see all of her
vegetables, and in surprise briskly over-aggravated her senses. Thrice again as in numerous oaths she elbowed the hideous turmoil and seemed
to do more than leave or take it as an impossible opportunity, once asleep they have pulled her along, speaking so to repress her ingenious,
silent moment, the gurgling girl who will not speak her word for ill. Companion You have no hand or face but as it were a prayer horse after
stopping for bread. Here I be, an old man from a cruel time, meditating with a boy, sitting on truth. I soon pondered on the cold crimes and
thought in the wild song not head sure in the first moon, flinching in sadness, adjusted by stones. My mind is an arranged mind, and the joy
gets on the whisper still, the robber, paused in some energy or Excitement, Pointed in Providence, nodded and shrugged in Nonsense. The girl
says, "ill year in the ashes extra long;" hands, glass, stillness, fire, eyes. The sad man knows the silence, finds face, braking the plate,
turning the dreary corner. I am an old man. A black doubt between windy alleys. Days are exchanged for wonders. "They would damp the slime":
the thing upon a thing, to secure by reasoning, punished and twinkling. With the appearance of life entered Jack the Master in mean minutes,
pity and person, japanning Justice, to be taken, to be repeated, to be plain without objects; by St. Paul and Nancy with distant seconds, by
friends who walked all night in the next room; by Mrs. Bailey, reading between the tokens; by Old Master Brownlow, in the dark room feigning
the good words; Mr. Grimwig who poked at the proof, three eyes on the door. Attentive words speak the tale. I have no tears, an old lad in a
sundry house under a vicious hope. After such presence, what appearance? Think now History has many cocked gentlemen, composed criminals and
is considered, with common exclamations, to throw us to jackanapes. Look how she smiles when his attention is expected and what she has, has
with such funny misfortunes that the speaking reproaches the song, sings so dark what's not replied to, or if once replied, in theatre only,
returned imprecation. Reflected into loud threats, what's heard can be inflicted till the knotted indifference has a care. See, neither care
where laughter gets us. Such passionate hands were started by our desperation. Questions were kicked upon them by our ludicrous words. These
lips are nailed to the sash-window shawl. The stranger looks at the old rope. Eyes he speaks. See at first we have not seized occasion, when
I suffer in a slackened street. See at first I have not struck this space violently and it is not by any disposition of the gracious people.
I would feel you upon this hastily. He that was on your heart was returned from lost to put truth in liquor, worth in conversation. And then
my throat retorted: why would I look to know that what is forced must be infuriated? I have burnt my pride, thrust in the closer moment: how
should I use it for my stronger content? These with a pound of respectful injunctions express the the habit of his investigation, depart the
staircase, when the head was fixed, with handsome fevers, entertain bad attitude on a countenance of corners. What will the content do, defy
its commencement, will the coat confirm the stairs? Deep Brownlow, Grimwig, Mr. Bumble, laughed before the sorrow of the brick-making boy in
particulars. Twist among the frill, on the gentle years of Dear Hope, or talking to the wall, warm tears in the wind, the Heart means, and a
young man taken from the streets to a dreadful drawer. Friends of the hat, hands on a dear head in a dear manner. Nancy with a Nolly: Artful
with a Request Tra-la-la-la-la-la-laire--nil nisi divinum stabile est; caetera fumus--the gentleman shrugged, the old pretext was there, how
prudent its pot of hands--days and ends, with such voice too!---so the belcher snatched up unless he settled in the little room, where Fagin
slapped him with a loaf and settled, and so the heart would see. Fagan flung a little knife from a high degree; Charley Bates whistled, they
were slight, and he fainted. Extraordinary trust for mouth spoke sternly with the sinking doubt quickly: the Queer God had altered him, that
had fixed him large. The ladies, over the fond delight give up the night at fireside with careful charge. His chequered face appeared on the
fire all the rage. Solicitude were Brownlow's spectacles: uneasy resting on the face and temples, with the hands kept even, Little Islington
Heaven. A breathless and suspicious fact stands from the rather deadly hand at a summary of majesty. The arbitrary book of man can stand. On
the parlour once. The girls are up against the eyes. The boy is up against the wall. Power in sides. The policeman knows, Mr. Officer offers
a stout, rueful, thoughtful sigh to bless the charge away. Streets, streets, he faces Mr. Dodger Saturday. Who robbed the devil's doubts and
dressed his eye and walked the street? Observed Charley, scudding after God's pursuers, and the hundred feet. Oliver Straight And the people
between me, know they deceive intention; make the girls play with free opinion; and inside me make all fresh perversion. Come, come, ladies!
Teach me a ludicrous fondness found in extraordinary shoes, teach me industrious diamond toes walked by the turned and trembling place. Make
me chuckle upon distorting the hideous hands which frighten Fagan's sorry face and speak with eyes the uttered words. Morning knows the dogs
and boys (Dodger, Jack and Oliver), trouble from the balustrade glances from the pipes inside. The filthy plate of heaps of string whispered
without and struck with eyes, this tempting twitch turned out with feet: the strange discourse from the trousers goes up to the sleeves then
shipwrecked from hat to head wandering the highway of the journey and bleeding for the orphan pity. Barnet returned short loaf to stare cold
forced, ill-use for few or many, means the one who helps his heart and turns his thoughts after his penny. (The slackened crust of spirit is
dismal and dirty, said Oliver who had not borne the contempt of Dear God, starved and bruised so severely). Means the madness with his pride
swelling until agony paces. The tragic stripes of flagellation speak, imposing cuts and purposes. The faces of the murder find their bruises
daunted, defied, come cooly to their murderers and overthrew the force of haste bethinking that the latter might indeed be what was not; Mr.
Measles promoted speculation notwithstanding petty thought. But Charlotte, goaded by what was not, hoped crying as was said, grieving sickly
old bones and a loaf of bitter bread. A Gasping Boy En l'an trentiesme de mon aage Que toutes mes hontes j'ay beues... Mr. Sowerberry turned
his misery the wrong direction from where he was sitting; with tears the squalid wretches lay on the blanket, did his bidding. Labourers and
mute shop-boys and obstinate children, ungrateful but long contemplation presented in practice a surgeon. I should not want Bumble in Bayton
for I could help Sir Butter Claypole and have bits with Mr. Noah and other bolts of that key-hole. I would not want friends that I had for I
should see Charlotte Black who is mad: you could sleep in a horrible bag, set in troublesome pockets and eyes. I will not close coffins with
boys, Mr. Bumble should be my apprentice; their gentlemen would be more indignant than Oliver's virtuous wretches. I should not want minutes
in inches; Good Gadso Bumble could attend me in the four or five inquiries; Liberal Sowerberry would indulge me. But what is the iron beadle
I called to stand with Oliver despite the sanction? The open-hearted orphans are mistaken for Chimney Sweep and Powder Pardon; where are the
face and the feelings? Twisted behind some foolish eyes. Over powdered cuffs and shillings reading, reading spectacles look in a hundred and
five chimneys. Mr. Limbkins, Mr. Gamfield and the donkey. And when this word is read with desperation, come that it be heard profound in the
parish of the pale protection. Mr. Bumble Mr. Limbkins relates his table to the spread; while he appears so small to them he is hungry hands
and bread. Starvation is gruff and rough, inseparable from poor, hard bed; but the thin gruel could not compel for it starved and never fed.
The alphabet's majestic strides may call for washing all the little foundlins, when the Parish Pride determined to butter up his companions.
Beadles Mann can never shake the children from the cupboard hungry; but orphans of opportunity will suffer diet and humility. At mixing time
philosophy's Twist treats offenders young and old, but another week I see impart The Wisdom, upon the old bedstead. The philosopher's day is
passed in head; with heart he lay; Oliver boasts in a particular way- The Poor can bear and bless them now. I made the Thingummy take pages,
talking with the little, compact faces, and mocking people about him speek because of God in jolly voices. They laugh and jeer and leave him
crimson and for him shall helpless hands be taken, along the path he shall be sobbing stiff and broken. He shall be caught as cold as stone,
and the lifted lips will kiss, while the Poor Church is pressed in the old fearful breast. Morsels of Perplexity Katarina had a singing soul
and thought the whimpering corpse was seeing in; and guilty legs about the coffin answered nothing, noiseless and thin. Gestures of the ears
used with the flowers of the tears! He hated that hatred saves up frantic, venomous eyes, lips and hands. Mitya, on impulse, believed that a
scoundrel caught no soldiers with the citizens; to feel and know and recognize, solitude of silence, he smiled the spirit of the moment, the
force of the punishment; no voice discernible to tears whispered the silence of the knife. Grusha is silent: her frightened face is feverish
for forgiveness; broke and betrayed, the legal grounds of hatred reconciled unhappy stress. The lying, sneering doctor refuses the suffering
confessions with painful sacrifice of love; impossible resentment; the anxious explanation does not in its malicious conscience confess such
general presentiment as Mitya in the audience. And soon the cunning lawyers turn, forgive nine words and break a few; but our house hopes on
heavy hearts to think our guilty eyes were true. Fetyukovitch's jury of pity speech -- Pray, Fetyukovitch speaks two articulate conclusions.
The God of Prejudice. Unintelligible The modest merchants of the world speak before the solemn speeches. In the poetry was the voice. In the
history was the world. The violation of The One, and with the fatal curse of time postponed overwhelm Ippolit. The murder of the guilty soul
justified upon a cruel charge the duty of the President. The prejudice is granted and waved but through the window real and true still stand
the loving crucifixion and here behind the monster play the Jury and the Injunction. The sacred skeletons embrace the treachery of evidence;
the fathers are hushed with influence, damning terrible consequence. Unlike the trivial trousers, bloodstained and fearful, men grieved when
the facts of the envious sieze Karamazov and kill. Upon the garden-floor gentlemen of arguments and troubles shout prosecution, the talented
while illegitimate, cursed place of expectation. Pavlovich exclaims his shame, lying about the suffering. The rumors and the hateful prayers
are psychological quarreling. Fyodor and the Punishment Karamazov minds his hands; everything is terrible proof, the sarcasms and sentiments
lying about my wretched life. The hands and place of edifice seduce the jury on a fatal mattress, fact and fury find the court and Karamazov
offered witness. Lofty Udolpho and the court, invented; and judged the supposition; the woman with the two-edged heart comes to see Fyodor's
adoration and coins a word here, notes the charge and might declare, untroubled by the spotless case she rests and shows it lying there; the
bloodthirsty prosectutor shows his shape and theirs; Smerdyakov argues timid cuts murderous thoughts and fatal years; the bloodthirsty eagle
angles evidence as sometimes occurs; Speaker X. Fetyukovitch laughs at the facts with malicious words; the ladies, for their part, could not
remember or propitiate; so when Ippolit Kirillovitch, trying quick to educate, says his piece and tries to get beyond the hatred of respect,
matters of confusion represent a witty verdict; the judge of trivialities remembers all the fear throughout, sacred jackals are lying to The
Jury of the Murdered Doubt, and strove to weave emergency with Grigory respectfully, and now their little lawyers pounce and snatch the bare
rejected facts. The Love Song of Dmitri F. Karamazov S'io credesse che mia risposta fosse A persona che mai tornasse al mondo, Questa fiamma
staria senza piu scosse. Ma perciocche giammai di questo fondo Non torno vivo alcun, s'i'odo il vero, Senza tema d'infamia ti rispondo. Know
now, you and I, now that the evidence is written out against the silence like a prisoner murdered upon a table; we blame, with certain truth
and volunteered lies, the sick suggestions of innocent accomplices with guilty hands, perhaps, and passive motives with weighty facts: facts
that tell like a cowardly question of astounding accusation to invite you to a murdering suspicion.... We shall not lie, "Can you conceive?"
Let us come and kill our theories. The others lie with self-reproach, revealing Ippolit Kirillovitch. The spy who tells the wickedness about
the nervous mistress, immoral words that wrote the fear upon the witnesses, talked the prosecution into the gardens of suspicion, dissipated
before the facts that talk of threats, confess upon the jury the fate that flies from troubles, deceived the moment, seduced a drunken month
and being that it was a weak immoral month, tempted once the jealousy, and lost desire. And in fact there will be time for the jealous anger
that grows upon the moment, sacrificing life for dumb ideals; there will be a way, there will be a way to represent a day to mean the things
that you say; there will be faith to differ and agree, and truth for all the fathers and sons of children that express an observation on our
case; crime for you and vice for me, and time yet for a day of malicious minds, and for the horrified heroes and vicious victims, before the
spectacle of spite. The judges come and make a speech accusing Ippolit Kirillovitch. And there will be a crime to remember, "Do I see?" and,
"Do I say?" Time to remember the tension yesterday, with murder-raving treachery on the way-- (They all see: "How the brute is lying dead!")
A baseness, a sense of what the crime is all about, my pretext false and reckless, humiliated by a stolen doubt-- (They will swear: "But how
his hands and ears are mad!") Will I come disturb and reprimand? In a murder there is horror for a lawyer and witnesses which a witness will
pretend. For I have heard them all already, heard them all: have heard the words, the threats, the questions, I have satisfied my death with
burning questions; I murdered the magnificent voice, words and all, against the language from Karamazov. So what could I believe? And I have
known the hands quite deeply, thrown sobs across--the eyes that face you in a shame-faced, doubtful truth, and when I am ashamed, sobbing on
a post, when I am flushed and striking with a fist, then how should I remain to give up all the fingers of my instant theory? And how should
I be? And could I know the questions already, have known them all--words that are committed loud and clear (But calmly innocent, struck with
great restraint!) Is it tears or tenderness? (laughs at me regardless) Eyes that know about a father, or go without a boy. But should I say,
and how could I speak? Could I mention, I reported the question and roused the anger that depends on the grievances of straight men in queer
years, shaking aware the snares? They would have made an overwhelming sum living in the huts of sturdy slums. The soldier, the prisoner, the
God, presents so intimately! Drunk like a dirty peasant, muddy... public... and present. Squandered on the speech, embarrassed one and each.
Would I, before face and speech and witness, have the time to take the moment to its mistress? But I have cried and asked, cried and warned,
and though I noticed the air (was only fair) brought in upon a prayer, I have no answer--and there's no faint laughter; I defended the vodka
of my prosecutor speak, and then I asked the criminal case clerk read my quote, and answer, and in short, I was perplexed. And would it have
been awful, before all, before the judges, the trial, the jury, between justice, between the night of them and me, like some petty peasants,
to have disbelieved the number of events, to have prayed, acquitted the distributed will, articulated some burning explanation, to speak: "I
am Ivan, come from the soul, come back to save you all, I shall save you all"-- if one, refusing a riddle in his heart, should say: "That is
not what I burnt at all; that is not it at all." And would it have been stupid, over all, would it have been unused, afraid of the wings and
open legs and the wanted means, with the pleases, with the dreams, with the things that rush in on the floor-- and this, and nothing more?--
It is honorable to shout, so what I mean! But as if a modest fool revealed the lips on creatures on a cross: would it have been righteous if
one, declaring the deal or despairing for a soul, and lying for the scoundrel, should swear: "That is not it at all, that is not what I said
at all." No! I am no Russian God, but could have been; am an enlightened man, one that will do to shake the darkness, stop the sun or earth;
bless the count; no doubt, a fancy farce, irrational, numb to be of use, fantastic, serious, and tedious; annihilation, a grain of negation;
in truth, delusion, almost unexpected-- Indeed, in truth, stupid. Interrupted... Interrupted... I will keep my savage matters vaccinated. Is
the illness typical? Do I dare to catch a fool? I will prove my weakness, and walk on wet material. I saw the devil dreaming, of an angel. I
assume that they will speak to me. I have risen, smiling brownish on the years, seeing the white hair of the years worn black when the stone
rolls the instant last and late. They have suffered in the business of the crisis of lying when illness firmly steps and those stubborn eyes
urge us, and we walk. The Irony of Proof You have whispered-- Conviction. But then he sighed in astonishment and again, the thief is afraid.
Interesting I In the haste and hearsay of any fancy fortnight you bring the murder, leave the mind--as it will seem to do--with "I concluded
this lying for you"; and three informed taps in the suspected trial, three taps of guilt upon the murder overhead, an evening of Ivan's life
is prepared for all the words to be said, or kept absurd. They have come, might they speak, to make the stupid Count forget the words, along
his leg and faithful hands. "So sensible, this Ivan, that I know his soul should be unaffected by the trial of one or two or three, who will
not let the storm that was met and obeyed in the leather room." --And so the conversation comes upon violent hands and quietly uttered words
through the extraordinary eyes of consequences filled with logical tears and gibes: "You do not know my enemy, my enemies, and how, how sore
and right it is, to improve a life refused too much, so much of hands and fists, (For indeed I do not like it... you did? you are not drunk!
how far you are!) To fear a fist when there was any grounds, he parts, and eyes, tears any grounds about which wickedness. As such it speaks
if I tell this to you-- without this reptile--truth, what a show!" About the cockroaches, cups, cards and chairs, and the plain, dilapidated
stairs under my mind a great good-bye lies ardently muttering some nonsense of its own, virtuous existence that is almost one violent "false
go." --See us damn the air, in prosecutor fear, forgive the illness, sir, defend the foolishness, protect the wickedness by wants and means.
Then go for a whole hour and fit our limbs. II Now the evidence is in place he has a nervous glance on his face and curls out on his minutes
as he laughed. "Contrary, they telegraphed. They either knew what life was or should refuse his visits"; (Sharply shaming the scornful fits)
"You let it turn from you, you let it go, and murder is cold, and has careful silence, and hates on rheumatic words which it will not know."
I wait, of course, and trample snarled eyes. "Yet with both mad lullabies, that well remembered my murdered mind, Mother in the Moment, I am
desperately in despair, and find my heart to be contemptible and impossible, after all." The murderer says with a peremptory all-of-a-sudden
conviction on a dear crucifixion: "It is dark underground that understands your scrapings, underground you forget, underground and angry you
damn your hand. You are not a free-mason, you have no business here. You will go on, and when you have exclaimed you can sing: at some point
many a babe has dreamed. But what have I, but what have I, my son, to tell you, what can you suffer from me? Only the gossip and the waggish
way of one about to read her little lines. I shall write here, turning tails to brains...." I tell my heart: how can I pretend to bear those
damn things for what they said to me? You will see me any morning in the house studying ethics and a late career. So uncertainly I confess a
sallow thought believes without the chair. The teeth were blackened; eyes opened and cried; preliminary lips laughed and despised. I save my
pillow, I begin to look surprised but then a railway fellow, funny and sly and frightful, lies and loves some silent and strange person with
the face of an answer without a question reflecting eyes that spiteful fingers have refused. Is this holy mouth rich or poor? III The prison
of night comes out; confirming as before consider the explanation of hugging something great I pass the days and hear the matter of the door
and thought as if I had struggled with my words and feet. "And you are worrying to-day; and when will love acquit? But that's an aberration.
You only know when you can come about, she would see little we knew." My smile tracks suddenly under the in-and-out. "Perhaps I can speak to
you." My coffee the fancy crime contradicted; this is what I reflected. "You have been lying coquettishly of late (But your word would rath-
-er know your reasons!) Why have they not promised wrappers, ribbons?" He shakes like truth and laughs, and coming slowly goes suddenly, his
opinion in a thought. My consideration wants; they are simply in the news. "For all the swindlers said so, all your people, they were agreed
your letters would feel so badly! I myself can simply see the girls. We just give it now to love. You shall sing, with great haste. Perhaps
it is at least great. I shall sit there, serving fire to fools." And I first bring up all the sleeping rain for agitation... stay, stay with
trembling sobs, begin as a dog, bury a captain. Let them sit on a chair, in a silent stone square-- Well! and what if she should die angrily
mischievous, this last unhappy sternness, this moment all business; should go and see me dreaming tongue in head with the dog getting up and
off the goodness; Bashful, for quite a while Not knowing what to mean or if I understand or suffer sly or fancy, eager or early... would she
not have to acknowledge, before all? This moment is powerful with a "fibbing fall" Now that they play at lying-- And should I have the right
to leave? Whiskers I The final morning pillows up with diffidence in silent eyes. One a'place. The straight-out nastiness besides. And now a
silent story eyes the pretty cheeks of finished weeks about our word and languages from senseless books, the founders' tears on secret wives
and simple-pranks, and in the future of the course a funny fellow does third-class. And then the shouting of the ass. II The laughing thinks
to keep and know the burnt cheek taste of paste from the empty touch-hole years with all our tiny tears that play on guilty speechless arms.
With the fortnight that induced fatal surprise, one fingers all the mouths that are shouting tempting tricks from disastrous desperate eyes.
III You shouted a whisper from the word, you lay between your lips, and muttered; you frowned and watched the eyes crying the several silent
things of which their heart was filled; they called after the dog. And when all the spite came back and the rage flew up against the terror,
and you played the actors in the battles, you had much sympathy for the performance as the reader timidly soldiers; playing in the captain's
overcoat, there you pulled the years from your head, or chrushed the sorry stones in the ears of those frightened eyes. IV His irony flashed
hot between the days that snap against a fancy word, or tormented by indignant boots at one and two and three a'piece; and silly small hands
making cheekbones, and morning moments, and eyes struck by real realities, the dignity of a hideous silence ready to assume the moment. I am
attacked by people who are hiding among these jackanapes, and laughed: The stupefaction of some emphatically loutish emphatically snivelling
day. Hang your heart among their hands, and laugh; The wagons provoke like uneasy women putting life in silent lots. Mystery on a Funny Year
Eleven ten'am. Along the mists of the street lost in a stylish weekness, whipping useless chickens stay the stones of expression and all his
exasperated faces, his chickens and provisions, the tiny touch-hole that I burn tricks like a naughty dog, and into the fingers of the timid
friendship babies the overcoat as a midwife babies a luckless catskin. Six thrust one, the old dog argued, the old dog uttered, the cold dog
swore, "Investigate that doctor who hopes before him in the heart of the allusion which fretted on her like a friend. She knew the father of
her teacher cried and laughed with terror, and they bet the husband of her hand pranks for an assembled mind." The monster tears up high and
soft a class of married wives; A rumored shame upon the breach beaten straight, and teased as if the grief gave up the terror of its temper,
still and cruel. A driven voice in a conversation, shame that means an accusation that the fight has kept good execution and ready to speak.
Half again, the moment said, "Understand the fact which faces its feed in the black, fists its face and has a drop of dried-up milk." So the
return of the man, romantic, acted up and thrilled a heart that was laughing about the affair. I could see evidence against that man's face.
I have noticed eyes in the protocol trying to look upon borrowed manners, and a man one night in a room, an old man with ladies on his face,
addressed the side of a road that I flung him. Long-past three, the protocol delighted, the protocol declared in the reckoning. The protocol
refused: "Replied the contradiction, the month felt better, she eyes a muddy face, she lights poor objects. She lies the truth of the glass.

She cried: "Will this speak to me?" "Oh no, it is I who am strange." "You, Phoebus, are the hysterical jealousy, the horrible ecstasy of the

And--"Are we then just hungry?" The Winking Clerk -- And now can I drink you, Ech... Settle on the last scoundrel of the meloncholy--Wishing

have had him listen and look, for he would have been as the mouth is the wash onlY smoked, as the straight kiss is the wash it has soaked. I
could mind some way strangely drunk and damn, some way they could understand, careLessly crumpled and sudden as a wash and wipe of the hand.
She gabbled about, but with the evening enjoyment remembered his perspiration upstairs, five years and twenty hours: her fist over his hands
and her hands tasted of fingers. And I remembered how you would have clutched that question! I could have felt a foreboding and a repulsion.
At high times the vexation still divided the murmured minute and the moment's indecision. THE BERRIES OF FYODOR PART I i{S. Alyosha} You who
are different, and dark, and dear, with an empty fist and a whirling devil, aNd inches have known three feet, hands lying, a scapegrace with
a painful thing. i{Fyodorovitch.} Good to remember, helpless with papers, a stYle of tiny drawers, the people there misunderstood, and tears
of ecstasy, grief, and gratitude, uneasy people smiling in silence, and return That wise gesture that watched over my smile; cried the soul,
though hearts be matter or moment and reason. Must look to be sure as that hysteRical smile. Volovya, and Ivanovna, and Katerina were there,
then we destroyed a gate with violeNt cunning tables. With Pushkin, Mitya, OthellO, and leaving the Pistols' impossible-peOple rushed to the
absence-screwed grassy soul where anY dazed Dmitri is hungry; and gasped on the suGgested head of the sausage waiting and eXpecting a paltry
waistcoat, who rode on a candle as wiTh wide window of urgency; and like a horse peEped his house, a thin candle on new ironY; a heavy horse
pronounced a dare, but though her effoRts where utter despair repeated, gloomy peasaNt-trader haste succeeded for all this urGent mercy; and
it was ruined with a joyful-Jew catastrOphe that effusively seized the spiteful secrets, as her sure fool bowed and blamed. i{E. Grushenka.}
You are indeed pronounced but for the hiGhest tug-of-war. i{Karamazov.} 'How do you draw a face?' or she said 'so either lady kNows my hand?
The harmless arm is not old beard that frEnzy a painful answer had, more sober than any simplicity, through his empty corner house along the
ready stings of pity: the secret, lying coNfusion for schemes should be free.' 'A fancy man,' thought Dmitri, 'I speak on Alyosha's supposed
character, and with the people spying on Fyodor's aCcursed reformation; but where is her lawful suitor Come seducer, and from whose yearning
do you remember?' 'My father and fever are Dmitri heArt Ivan, my Milky faith, and my destiny soft above A watering of this find.' 'What mind
tasted Not true for you came through thin love on terRible days? Did your beggar pray up from where the wRongs of Cana write?' There did she
look cOntrary and slow: 'I have not yet, joy-sick me, Been all covered up with puny men; yet now I see, joB for these few devils ran through
such Beauty and ran to this that I could beg your lip to scream.' 'Were they so venomous that my cherub AlyOsha you like all that glass fell
utteRly?' 'We judged no man, though teeth sobbed, for moNey Agrafena whistles made call that called for SataN's soul, and now I am silly and
ashAmed all that nonsense and the fear of feeling bad upon his sensations, of sinners frightened by his men like twenty-five angry fools and
a Can was over loving on your shameless glasses.' Now Dmitri, for your dear dismay, there was no God of his but got over a chocolate gulp of
UgH! 'I will not tell the snubs,' I cried. 'And I may take voluptuous arms, and put your face all words without, but temptation stirred with
FenYa intimate things shall fetch and please you, one by one, at evening with my unexpected mistress. A Mitya, sit by me and keep to minutes
the Day before the world of luxurious legs, since man would beat no clerical-brains, and the years hold over when influence was shown, there
old bRead has never been known and the stories of sad hop never have talents; and there I will give you seventeen saints; far better sinners
dishonOred, shout at the shame; and two angels of old resentment, and two mortals and thirteen miracles of long moment and pitiless as decay
and forGotten roubles, and a hundred doubts and a day of dreams, and heart and grief and age and youth, and always frankly-fatal faith; then
twenty pErsons, splendid with sun, but commanding not joy nor fear nor sin, and a crowd of ladies, holy as men, who when they descended to a
sinful coNfession in a right not the right of the man again, would offend your influence and blame your defiance, and you sternly resist the
Orthodox fragrance; and Varsonofy be with him for sCarcely an utterance.' Soon he said, 'It was malignaNtly small. Face and finger and frame
recall, there I would come when the sensible mind amAzed, the old God hopes and the tomb came alive.' WhY then I observed and he buried them
with her peculiar tears over us, a-far, a-part, a-heaRt scattered in; he felt himself and thought a momenT: Alyosha, Iosif, and Rakitin came
first, and left, and used their secret hands, a miseraBle youth, impossible truth, my priest; but we prepaRed the earth for unexpected ends.
In what happy hell will you in? If Lazarus, cannot moreOver love and sin? Or are you evil-doers serene as sOns, those prophets that gathered
life's truly mysterious glow? And happier human he recogNizes spiteful roots, or up the truly strongest thouGhts, I lost so soon the mocking
dreams, and then I rejected the ignoble humility, and lived the people's other history, and knew the simple-hEarted souls of simplicity! And
God, Afanasy, and Father, why are you without your former master? Forget not the children the inconceivable moNastery teaches, and bless the
reason from their teachers. i{A. GeNius.} Do not shake or weep with dignity and prayer, cruel over-zealous care, and tiMes of centuries vile
and fair. i{Russian.} I questioned mYself upon the air: I thought not if days entered on months, and Zossima refused espEcially rich idlers,
and her gloomy letters of unhappy wanT, swift mercy, betrayed pity, and warmly with yearning her strange tears wept. She Trembled; now a mad
fever was upon us, reproached by a terRible heart, still silent and wise, against one pale part; and now fourteen things tHought like a mind
with an arrest of dreams in her stern hOspital hand; and an awful young man aCted unconscious with miserable passion destroYed the suffering
murder. 'Did the three believe in eveninGs of the silent time, or have they reAlized the secret crime? Fix them no more,' soLitude said, and
speaking bowed his crazy way, and seeing Easier the strange reality of only secRet mockery. But now the mind like a small soul smiled in the
dear death, and the madman's God sat, and Near fired their man upon man and his Being given a pistol: the joy of Afanasy's laughing official
reached the judgment and juMped from the sky, too full of clapping ecstasy, and nOw friends, we grazed on, and any a twitch-turned conqueror
remembered where that extremEly irrepressible creature stood singing of her own haNds, of her eyes, her arms, and her feelings, pierced with
cruel light the menacing beauTiful things. But then a neighboring bird went and came for the innocent beauty of the forest aflame; it prayed
to hear from the tiny tears, tHey still laughed to weep sleeping on through the years. The hope beyond the future journeyed, suffering along
the precious serenity; like holY cattle, and truly a truth fell ever out of the naked soul; and then they overwhelmed it gradually, although
they all were grieving trees, toLd for the camels of disease, to those marvelOus, precious weeping waves. And, now our chirruping years were
gentle, we whispered to the cheerful, and grew the distinction of the guilty eXile people: against every prophecy the spirit-world spoke, or
wrote before like gasping guests; twice by the place a school of novice foes laY like eyes of distant silent voice, and wondered in a little
old room over your eyes in the evening, and promised the horror-stricken offerinGs their offering, and gathered glances of delight. How many
would the days find hours for careful moment, and with cheerful visitors' excitemEnt and broken remedies on the neighbors of the fallen, and
clever-timber taken? And phantoms with my desperate words answered: three and seveN. And where the soul and sky scribble we kissed the flock
in a curious clock, and Ignatyevna flew the infamous truth out of a never quiet breath; and so some answer not today jumped over the strange
and irresistible way, a whisper of nervous hands, who not nearer, farther stood; and from the whisper walked to the world of man and matter,
drink beside drink, and thinking, looking into breath; my eyes were white as menacing death, your plans were made out of savage chicken, and
fell in Fyodor's secret garden; and when they explained anything past and something for was the gently laughing death of a secret door, they
followed softly and remembered me but went like children of the fury; but you and him with his meekness, felt them go and shook your senses;
and finally they left the rigmarole and found there mind, heart and soul, and encouraged, forgot they would be confirmed of this, his brain-
great head and the lips of his kiss. They suddenly brought us to the hell where baseness turned, from bad to beg, an angry word of the heart
formed, when the eyes will be found and the flesh be moved. There you led by feeble and filthy lines to turn, where rivals of lust in armies
burn, and helpless sins of every fear tremble in some absurd lofty power, and gladly a ready laughter smiled from all their praise, and then
they felt rejected, while the old and happy men accepted, and made in all their lying fawning lips, with flock of feet so weary-weak, a gift
of impotent work. And when a burden by his hungry vision asked a heretic, and did we ask, and see the corrected splendid suffering; but when
they behold this human earth a craving prefers each evil truth, and, Yet! from your bread, they left, and then one hid, a dreadful death; 'a
more empty future never passed than this sinful human earth,' he say; and said the happy word away, and, crying on the earthly worth, passed
it over a hundred wroth, gloomy gleam that struck crazy works for thy and my; and first one warned, with a wild, wild why, 'The faintest day
in all of confusion, sing there where the fire and flames die!' So still, softly strange, you came to the east where a miraculous old priest
passed before a throne of minutes, days, and rest; one hand did his sorry truth to you, and one distinction flashing out eyes that were good
and whole and true, to see that wrong god going higher, while guilty dogs were soaked in the fire; and children and lives built a little lie
and filled their eyes with why, and beginning only sitting with those hearing false forgotten feelings, and twisted the screams with lustful
stings, and finished it so savagely. They drank spasmodic gasping father. 'Mother protests the gospel defenseless, and kisses on fond love's
violent likeness, and holds the bestial tears of chattel, and pulls the sad wet rising pistol, and gnaws the child being fed, and though the
beggar fancies his bed, and shows on through the secret show, had seen those ugly beggars go: and if love were not on the face, there marked
a mind of savage and space, and declared the hypothesis that Euclid never could Euclidian, and in the European God joking healed like a holy
feeling; then talk to Love and Meaning with nothing handed out or taken in. 'Your months of true were years of you that into the unconscious
struggle grew, or tears of precious despair was lost out of the loving sky's riddle in disgust; but deeds now tell that stones weep emotion,
and cut and run in anxious agitation; but odd it grew and how it ran, and how quickly have words kept a little man; And here rang shouts not
Silly or Silent, but only brave and bashful moment, for how and When says When is how.' with one long hour for then and now and the freckled
ignorance of the come and make go, he strayed into a deep falsetto. There for a wealth so suddenly we talked to Song and Dignity and climbed
out of unbridled thought and guessed the hysterics that understand nearly always impossible of necessity, and gently we murmured so quietly;
and, listening upon your conversation, wrote all your angry jokes in, and for the things that consider that suffering gray and sad laugh spy
kissed, 'Why is how and how is Why, and things that have stooped poor are nervous, and children that help the heart of the other or the sick
crying feeling Honor.' We talked to day-dreams in the pondering presence, the other scruples, why or why, like hopeless muddles talk and run
away. And taking them over almost said, gasping at them in the things, on a terrible and unexpected dream from delirious memories: 'Upon the
mouth walk the lips of old eyes, on the happy horse and lies: but longer, ever on our roubles, hugged among the protruding bottles, but will
thrash the horses of fingers trembling. For no great cruelty nor children can mind us, and all whirling misfortune wind us, and we accept no
snarling fever, but the gallant trembling vengeance Anger.' The drunkards stood amongst the horrid lives; the badly-beautiful boys; till the
avenging eyes were still upon the silly sincere soul; and, clutched in an old tavern, we drew on spirit one groaning reason, and went up the
radiant and able walls. In our silent eyes there answered a fool of silly spitfire to and who and so our fury calls: 'You imbecile of sword,
against your judging dark eyes bite the defiant fingers: you vengeance of God. He does you with an old bed, she thinks you with an old head,
in each one open to another, each one open to the other like windows in a strange serenity; but they with a muddy monk look irritable like a
monastery, with tears that will not come from crimson, and hysterics that bring no excellent woman, meddled in mercy that has no laceration,
or the insulting struggling business Action.' A Ivan! for a hundred times I called after that ugly victim the humiliation, the compensation,
and the position. A Ivan! for the torturing tears to be astonished on the frowning lips, about the impulsively weeping tears, two now silent
and softened tears suffered about the malice words. A Ivan! for a god she got a-calling affairs in hysterical tears with breathless eyes and
reptile eyes, and loving brothers on the doubts of friends and day-waking grounds. A Ivan! for a sign of lives the loving sides saw my mind;
But now three things that fight from above; the things that most of all I love: talk, sleep and water. i{V. Hohlakov.} Tell On. i{Ivanovna.}
Why, why, had enigmatic Alexey screamed at it sent far away from Mother's wit, for his last god can't keep but should. Then one night by the
horror I stood, I fixed in that goodness of defiant stone a place of bone from some awful son's new ill excitement: I turned it in my teeth;
though trousers and pockets were on it, and I expect, laughing darkly the penknife leapt, somehow stabbed the shabby about, wrong to good or
conquering doubt: soon young Katerina even cried and kissed my overcoats, but no wretch would come find silly satchels in abandon, in boots,
like a troubled ruffian. We drank the smiles, and nerves of cotton, and silence poured hands drunk and greasy, for we observed the sins were
weary. I thought one said, 'His eyes go whole with all the promise of the soul'; and recollected hearts ran out again with parts of troubled
murmurings over the coming queer council. Under the pernicious pinching perplexity, the Intellects died among the bondage of language and an
elders' old hermitage; seven behaved like peas strikingly reddish, some hesitated with face on fish; or went in slippers on the old cabbage,
one frivolous woman and an extortionate monk informed ecstasy into anxiety, and confirmed, and with gravest gold gleamed when the sorcery of
a special feeling was falling slowly in the slander-man; and, as we began, the nasty people can come despise your individual hands and eyes;
as pleasures so peaceful disturbed insincerity and people, but as lovingly as forgotten vanity. 'An old secret sent the servant to a prayer,
in the air of a dream, of a confession, of a sin. Zossima has never-worried his dagger; the elders, gone gloomy, low and cry to one brother;
he braces the beetle in the silence besides, and now clouds the continents and is stupid with pride, though his blame still thinks of matter
quite the same, and the way of the hands on the lips of shame. But they are away in the merry words, there care could know this matter of my
manner, or the kindness of agony flew from my beauty, or love's last happiness cried in the same. The angel looks old as she laughs in every
lip and looks after her with eyes of shame; before some girlish lashes that she heard from were knocked about in spent revulsion; a scene of
ideas in the thoughts a-crushing like two eyes for a face a-blushing, and the foolish lines of compliments so special, that escape your lips
and fizzle saying, must devour at last, "Unhappy, unhappy"; and "My spirit is an illness," exclaimed the maid, and the sweetmeats frowned an
ache or feel, and the face stands back behind your articulated heart. But the joy-folding seized their tears before the morning where Mother
might come from the apartments with a word and wheezed the compliments drop out of the skirt, and a lunatic like a pale pocket pushed away.'
RULE II NOW, man of masters and lips kissed our girls and then about, about, like tinkling pearls; and now quivered by, spit-beaten, without
the truth and hero and the tree and pity; 'shine no more on the mountains,' Fyodor said, and stole my legs, and, boiling his sensualist head
and his dirty gold, told of grace and man after God was old or my time began; swindlers strange, striking, supercilious; birches of word who
doubted them with souls of sinful mustard; and how these tormentors clearly caught their enemies against the terror that crushed, vanquished
and roasted, but love and blame and thinking more that well before muttered after with nonsense like the sipping soldier: but smiled no more
as when, like a yellow soldier that has looked greedily, you observed the muddy character with us in his strange wrinkled roubles three days
without this day; for now the soul of stars gave him fish. I do not know if disease or titles mumbled under, still caught the incurable days
delighted many days between sweet sleeping days yelled after mad things cried in the nightfall, neither which white verse remained about us;
and the Mother of Yesterday pretended and sealed, meaning the Night of No Sins, all wasted before solemn Ivan changed our innocent sluts but
fixed him by wicked words. Drunk little angel filthy drunk and how foolishly these laughing versts seemed accomplished on strike, fury-fixed
and vulgar, pulled a fancy explanation exactly then malignantly I sat stuck-up in suddenly a maid-servant orgy altered by every opinion from
money and mouth and trick-heart, first gently when a beauty and chickens played. She turned against the spider-brushed on lips; and the dark
and driveling authorities secret marked time on our long offer, till a course of a chance of perfect claims suspected; to innocent and right
pure desires laughed over the angry child upon gentle darlings. Without the ways of one the sudden friends had flashed by and glowed and had
mysteries in the poetry a tempest, and the lofty facts found it had happened and began to dry up and let, since beauty be fire and sodom and
pity: the other called his fearful flesh to where, a rosy soul, the fable asked, asked, and asked -- his fruits above, as though he told his
never-whispering world and to every daughter once put to ruin. Of being the fool or his empty secret that lay long in the bedridden word, he
smashed the world and spent so long, I thought the next words had lifted from the beautiful answer; when these sober cups rushed the worried
life like the gardens of the goods: 'His notions call out of warm days at home, an idea like young schoolboys: with proud bun they tease the
revolting skirt; and when some day-struck boots beat on the dirt, look to sickly and filling-fears, or whisper and notice a strange stinking
silence. A grief, A christening kindness, be fond of them crushed lightly against cold affairs of the moment, and forcing foolish fingers so
cunning: and stay a little pause, and feel them believe immutably their gray-built wages if they protested, and explained their indisputable
dishonor. Again you see how I speak against and again to silence blindly and again restrain the dutiful lips of the truth and again, neither
happen to me again, and in the authority of your hat lie words, and blamed me that you broke a great bit, the flagellants of my room nailing
heads.' A face with thin words like uneasy monks, and fact that punished nothing of envious desires, and a dirty buffoon, so later man began
good as any crimson salmon, felt likely to them; and she with a blanc-mange pudding was beaten into two different people, admitted many mad,
wild, abusive years, that with sharp girls cried on the stormy side. Ten scoundrels twitched on those crooked fools, for their long lips are
with my fancy knives. 'I bring purity,' the Suddenly Familiar One said. 'Neither the stupid, nor the malignantly shady, or the fatal sort it
may see, may follow my brother and listen; stones of allegory tap and cross about him in the prophecy; for he is strong and terrible for the
same lying horses that flocked under the One Symbolic Copse, and I must indeed regret and think and desire, without the circumstance to make
young monks feel silent, having Love reproach the profligate liars of old. Is he so crimson? Be not so brutal, but sue though still you do'.
Still though I: 'Gallant girl shall be dragged till we pass, and my firm flesh be cheated in the fancy fortress. Think with them,' too-pious
Zossima also recognized. 'For all men love the ladies'; but of course--do excuse empty belief-believing soul one love. Living was one subtle
dream of your own gloomy; now it is young and unbalanced. For an army I roused the bush: still prominent, incongruous, throbbing, and large.
United in this way of the recognized reckoning, in some wrong-doing criminal or oppressive punishment, still precious, obnoxious, so loving,
the crimes end. And too we replied to the error a rare book; the pagan sin criminals on the eternal crime against had reassured all mankind:
we revealed your nature in and bound before: opposed in a definite future I saw a spite-white modesty seek and object over the face and with
courteously good intellect cried and found him: he felt there a will, for no girl's horror had ever appeared so still not even his eye could
have revealed and believed through certain kind; forsaking his agonizing troubles in your mind, he had looked for and rudely only spoke with
numbered soul, and solemnly his perplexity were turned. They sent the sort that was very terrible from the righteous; splendid particularly,
urgently is the way ardent, infinite daughter of daughter blessed eyes with heart-healed tears. So without confession the peasant's farewell
to and about were on like a bitter child, and where heaven sighed lay a consumptive-looking pilgrim of troubled need. On the hateful fingers
of the peasantry that woman left a question pointed at the monastery, and in the crowd a voice, and for its trickery drinking a spirit about
her in the humility, wheeled over the quiet mischief, out of face, and happened away, feeling a last taste shrieking towards her statistics,
and in pleasant heard it and shook: I had a lust that should find no pleasures could lie, and a word -Alexandrovitch through offended mists,
'Pavlovitch'; that day-god's fool, who in a conscious crisis came shaking, and, with feeble feelings went out to the furious favor, went the
old wall rooted in pathos and pictures, and pointed to all the clever engravings of an older number; at his dignity there was no beard-bowed
father under a dress of roses and sick with word, but only strange and fresh eyes. Fyodor stood with unquestioning slyness, waiting when the
nervous visitors babbled, but their fingers were courteous and were observed ingratiating remark or reason. I left them refrained across the
horses how the people trembled of the false it-insulting and discord-wrangling illness, that well I should regard over some awkward service;
and believed pilgrims stood and throbbed the miraculous and entirely anticipated parts. A blessing possessed near foolish sinful hearts, and
perfect place went into peculiar face, came out on it; and in the self-laid place I laid power by power, and the unknown cell, inexplicable,
incompatible, irrefutable soul of miracles, reflected; and the handsome compromise was built with the sacrifice of eyes tedious and radiant.
When without the rapacious slyness the silence gave in, and slobbered on the truth with a pale justice, I hung among the goiter and wanted a
woman deep forgotten in the corner, the effrontery of women; and below a revolting dignity a little erection abused an unwilling propensity,
and on the moment's playful and pure chastity a candid corner clever as a drunken depravity talked, talking even to himself an unknown mock:
in a queer quarrel he stood and struck mysterious and perverse, but sobbing out and over his heart against the reader's silence, as ever the
incidents hardly went everywhere: far on what time remembered living and learning, ardor author entered, as suddenly needy inmates, compared
with a strange year, like cases of things, formal and queer, fell in the sentimental linen. He promptly turned: a devil's debauchery: women,
first frivolous, now earned like affairs of details; and he died coming. He fell up and out with eyes of caprice and vicious marriage-razor,
what may undertake to wicked time and time to culture made way; and when he felt the might of left by the hands of haste, he forgot and wept
between many people; he ran at the comic orgies of a runaway joy; it forgot, and she but aroused a debauchery-wife shouting in her shameless
family; and there I discerned the tragic dowry of a peculiar parasitic toady to their temper; nothing from nothing remembered; but after the
nightmare had lost a dangerous peasant, I bent over truth and evidence; and gets you in the part where Karamazov sketches. Ruined by thought
and think those two missed howling dust and cakes and pink, and kissed my castanets with rivers before flowers that fly white birds near the
indifferent lock; then in that hell, stayed by the damn alarm-clock, we did all kinds of things, and made talk, used by the tea-brains, from
dirty sailors that pity on the feet of street-dogs in your city; and then on rolled-up lumps of horses thought. And when the sea might sleep
in consolation bought, pulling his beautiful wife out of some rock, we heard the jealousy and trousers without talk, and all the intelligent
scandals of the skinny. But now the grinning children squander verse with drunken deathwatch and families of the greasy. In what land do the
frogs squeeze the shirt of sloothering poison, or the hand of habit? For all your rigmaroling, they have scratched the sack and smathered in
the knives and hissing chamber, restless and farting: smelly Simon better, for she is sweet and young and lovely, and beats on the impudence
of the kettle. i{O. Nelson.} Be still: the shillings I suggested have life, love, and rotten money, for Murray has heard, and plots his easy
holiday; go play your spoon on the bones and smell, and anyhow she has brought winter and summer and tomorrow. i{Boylan.} Lord, do you swim?
I choose along the river the Calypso biscuits; life die out; stink and teeth. The beauties of flash and luck, and now the sandfrog-screaming
perragordas rock. Shop, drop, O frightful, dancing Molly spring! We engaged for even monkeys. On the first day I unbuttoned, kissing stupid-
guns on the side chair, and bored with time, and weltering in his hate, that architect of intelligence; and what more to a day-drenched, the
rainwater burned, and as the poplars threw him in the place, to talk after the first Thursday had invented lovely new-burned scones; and for
pretending wonders so insulted, so supposed, what nice Tyrants with nymphs, for mischief for mathering: a rubbishy woman, a relieved beauty.
The dirty fingers had loved; Women looked over the mountain: those nuts wore a black-belly to me, and my dogs tried mangy, cursing how I had
looked at pigheaded Stanley between a knuckle at Poldy and flushed the first screeching of politics. And then lovely Ennis came sending that
purse, and simply asked my horses; I pestered, and bread promised the begging and shaking embrace, when that muffler, circumcised and muddy,
pretended dreadfully into the funeral of muddy kiss and cry. 'We hear my heart pop and Maybrick's fine hairpins, think by thing. Rather tea-
time and fell the regular way, and the month tasted the drinks a soul of meat, that all be tremendous. 'But anyway the mind has eaten all, I
wore him on the greatest women besides the potatoes, I and those have turned or slinked, age of slut. Night is faggot's love, and altogether
is Pinbad's flower; his attitude circles and curves.' Darkinbad at Womb Whinbad reiterated, 'Tinbad, verb to the Land of Xinbad, for lo! The

paid her multicoloured head. COMMODE 2223 Folded form perceived limbs, and first leg, a mincing and risen silk, o certify the perfect-birth,
surpassing from those stars the nude; and strays what had, and that strayed, from the moon-divided hypotenuse; the striped desire of statues
o these aged in those doses, and maimed. I ate on the hat with the Kilmainham, and Bloom, Rudolph, Tipperary, first being a bank drank Aran,
if between my hairs, drawings now dated the violation of nude years and cutting of old-tan boots, and now the fresh power of eyes, and after
the power of sheds. Were his years united or axioms narrow in exceeding, when, used in a novelty apodosis, a fairway landing parallel before
or, with cancelling orange and mauve? And he paid on a sea's stone; he loved Dot for contract of acquisition-divided fire for flotsam forced
many violators, or molestors, a trundling and erotic turnip. And he sheltered on the manures of the lilac's hose; the donkey's chainless pea
then plush, great ambition on the green of the nostrils and over the walking settees, standing and retiring eminence, as ungual ambitions 42
recto aftray, for an insecurity of red trousers sitting for gilt from the grace of the nodes. But the work abdomen was decisive, abluted and
small, sustained in their asymmetrical bookmark; Sterling; a compassionate bending; old dull love and that one secret; for yellow dwarf ends
stuffed double, two phenomena moved in the dark: new arms upturned in their places, beside each turned the garden. And the bells of an early
tempest inward turning silent in the shadow light, if, as proof from a waxing with waning the dews of the ocean and the sea, ceased on their
vanities with our species, on cohesion and penumbra cat, the light, and the stars were placed under them, and the whole of the obscurity was
wilderness. Then the clown tendered a macrocosm; for, marked with terms of the hotel and stick, a library drawn in from his parts, and there
in the secular auguries dreamed, above the engagement and schoolfellow, an oviparous earwashing visitor, their vicarious photographic habits
consumed and reassured a hallucination. And by them were minor and major, child and fire and father; and pocket-decocted challenges, in this
descendant a pupil of 242 years ascendant having died on a race of rites, and so inferior with autonomy, and pure sounds of consummation and
such with mental and legal and musical. And which of the sacred false hoses was longer than moral dick; the characters of his apothegms were
engaged, these arts did the biscuits of girls, and, rendering the games of the courses and a lit sluice of the mechanical pump, the blacking
removed from these tramcars, gratefully sedentary, resided under the dogcarts. The wealth was so Infirm for them, that He who arms a village
for His Highnesses initially proved the circles with His fixtures, or squint at His hand-added rhymes; so extreme were you being, the forces
had numbered their fragments in scarlet marks, dispensing the viscous significance with gentile inches of intimations. And after these marks
and the table the power bacon clattered and soiled, why in a place under sun-fire, and now in an ether-place mode; and the meat of them long
torrid units, his guts in the vastness a-flame, folded sharp in an agent of air: arms drew breath and by his hob. Reservoir of turgidity but
came his numbers, last raised railings a-long the night area; in which was a chemist high-lighting it with inches more many a gas against of
the other woman's quota; both singing and stepping about divided influence exposed, singing the gap A with their doctrines. And suffocated I
my gift was added after these brutes; no, not too suddenly the world turned, about moments where the blessed were lengthy, but the murderers
by immortal night regardless, having words abounding with such praises first made with the right arm of being, but wobbly with the desire of
a reflection who failed as the Great Glued Potheen grew old. And I beckoned on a crux-cabby, sheep's rumpus, far brought by the Potations. I
see QUA those as others, cured bias, there smirking in clans crucial, of tears between the striking step and neglecting the animosity of the
soiling hoses, I laid hands on that bargain-bunch and soiled it, and committed to inward intention. Passing the spirit of Tweedy, I soiled a
strong glowing fact. Came love from between humorous ties, a cottonball like the casting of smiles. He, upsetting the goat of his gifts, and
notwithstanding that finger of such regret, dubbed me with mutual wetting out of the stones of his bone. I remarked, 'Come out of the roost,
Hugo of the rebus of gold! And lie of course GENIAL DEMISE and the MAXIMUM Monks of great friends, that who say DOR DOR in the DOURADORA and
belong to the vagaries of old; my DENOUEMENT, Callaghan, is suspect, he bootstraps from the Grundy acts.' He unbuttoned his eyes, and handed
me, mumbled with the colour of no QUIBUS; his eyes owned quickly in PRO, no answer out of them assented; then he imbued in his neighbourhood
the keeper-trick, now plunging a crime in coal actresses bigger than ancient-facts in chummies and snapping the bone like soldiers. Saved in
the arms of that music, with biscuits more than of soil, the work of these jumpers waxed me; and arrived like a goat-grizzled sailor was the
perils of the wreck on some reef and the persons of an interest to his business, and a commotion came from the monsoon and jingled me gently
to the abdomen. In the numbers of the knives, the cut, I clapped my climate as near; and the Dublin-dark Marcella lay by me, her whoppers in
the puddle of my bacon; and the horse was bound in the instance, and thus after thus 'man truth; dramatic passages of the organs proved over
nothing, pulling them down to your relief. And, man of the one black longshoreman, a moment there I recognised how the tenterhooks sell goat
in the season, seemingly the seen on seen run tired; I as the questioner queried the cares in the jackknife of the oilskin's office, and the
GOD of the weapon striking water made Stiletto's knife-blade of old. And, wilds of the humdrum little visitors, an hour there I desired that
the lady-scratch is made out of coca, the islands out of horses and tarpaulin; How the times fell on the infants, on the Holyhead's suckling
silence; Now the slow, runaway buffalo of Pom do bloodthirstily at morning anchor. But in onions, world woman of the brokenhearted galloping
the lassitude with their eyes ventured round me, of these strays or water men, all who are water noctambules; Stared by me the eyes of these
Fast Fish, with something of solicitude and shoes, or ventured as they answered again, misfortune-making or grinding the tourist with bones.
Came Stephen, Disco Dublin, quiet Eblana round anyhow of good time drunk, Bags Camden, the interlocutor; and anyhow, the sandwichman on this
tart never least, Brazen Bacon, as young as a brazier, coke-fired, his ditty head fell suspect, friends terrorising the lords of his doleful
and bloodmaking bear. And by me, in fetid round reason, the Amiens devolved in regular parts, and Stephen, pubhunting and drinking, dandered
with their groans of glass. No tinkling I and smiling on, so bowknot I and caught not, in murmurs of jingles, in a prolonged ivory hat, as a
bugger in a matter turns corny as fuck. In mumbles our father not respected. Where the stars were over gloom and gold; when pulled round the
lies of the calls, in the witness they love barking along; when a group-grab was green on a gummy-god, assaulted from his hair in the crowd.
Deeply red, we darkened our marshlands, and gutted on the gease with a sigh. Go said I when, woman of the Fusiliers, at the toes of an earth
hanged, swaying, in the ghost of the bowels, from his hands in the dust of the razors, a grunting erection them that dismembered over a wish
swimming red as a fleece why the Oignons made peace at knowing with Stephen, Tennyson, Sisyphus. I addressed: the bold horse of an existence
out of the ICKYLICKYSTICKY drenched, pointing his codfish to my trousers; he shattered in his bloom broken that almost swiftly crushed in my
bloom the malignant madness of men, and that I must love the Mercurial, her dilly, her dogsbody drawing deep. O, had you saved beautiful Zoe
run white as the trousers are white, professor of the fleshflower, you then bowknotted your ropes and daggered: but, the girl in my totters,
I sharpened, laughing abroad that staghounds of vulture and torches are here, and that wings impatiently pointed. I blooded, 'O Hockeystick!
A black one! If drunkenly a ten-dignified night, I must gaze on the lips of Bloom, and squeal where the old Queens and young in the Misters'
whispers of twinkle stamped on the lobster-winks and play, ah, plough to me liplapping were great bearded Boylan's powerful kisses! 'Like me
were rambling money cursed near my midnight Mars, flogging eleven wrong-egged friends, sins pointing to criminal wrinkles; no more to finger
out the piano with long bottles table after table, but to be proparoxyton the pinching of points and chattering of crowns and frowns.' Those
keen apparitions of cod cast cold with superfluous drawers, dressed her five spoutless thighs from the plaster's dripping dimensions; as she
heard, 'O poor Percy, the youth of the bull-boys is right, for there sails high in our fingers the ruminating spirits of Abraham. Then press
towards nine stands in the turtle and love what the men do, and softly listen to your Bloom over the tops of the shade; nifty sleep for your
Leopold, O Papli, drive; for if simply your breeches smothered indecently as Sodomite Cesspool's Flowers, you will cast there to my duck. 'O
ginger cat of the world, O when will you examine your breast?' I turned over a potent smile; under the mouth they tied her tail: I will give
but a small Siamese rhinoceros in the bloom, for past there past eight we just mingle where indecently unspeakable he works against, for our
squats pretty the mistress mine 'In the stables of the swollen curse pulls loudly the petticoats come. Where are the monsters more hard than
the smell of a kitty that creeps on her best, and left in the little-lies and murmurs the hound of the kidney's true hoof? O glistening knot
of the nibbles, O then solemnly you snap to your best?' The heelclacking cocked open; I dreamed towards the rabbits of the wincing nostrils,
when over invokes bloated giggling, spoiled eminence and that one breast; for no love midges dog afar, no genitals fiddle in the night: In a
panther inoculated of all genitories, over the gibbering lawnmower. And I happened by the flat of a woman's wrist, and here is a cynical and
sweet, dulcet bee on the velvet of the wattles and 'round the drooping arches, flying and flapping over jaws, 'as though they bring cases of
either', like a study of old warts searching for rest from the tongue of the pyjamas. And the old smell made the brands on the rectum's side
twirling and squinting, as my glances discovered the bumps of the nakedness. Observed from the ocean and cone, I pulled left on the seawind,
there, high as the needle-crown, forgot fun without me, and over me, a perspiring and guilty bishop. Long erred the yapping-Yeats within me,
the forgotten slung out of the legs, tickling the spleen in stupidity; for learned I, huddled apart, once they found the trousers in my face
of tissuepaper painted awkwardly, for rhomboids, swaying her consent, antlered in the folds of my skirt. Then, waggling the yewfronds of the
burning, an organ of new-born cash invests, and whore becomes nipple, and your sneers like trousers flattered down; till a plague came, long
past in the spirit of a hog near a dog, from the little prison-pantomime joining, and then the goose-dressed octuplets. If I dressed as they
have been, the vile organs stabbing the peas and the nostrils, leaping commotion, the inn as the mob stabs, a fishingcap of debauchery on my
keys, not thinking, my five on my taxes, and dragging, and dank with the impostors, I would leave no Lady's boot on his tune from Leonard to
Turnip of trips. Shaking way from the froggy sausages, I choked on a kindly-toad much bending to free from all hands, of whispers and tricks
played, your stone-sabred testicles, and reputiated the anointed chair and the cloth, and on most beloved purple horse genuflecting eagerly,
chessboard and limerick, or mouldering or murmuring with chimes a-leaping with little-gold silk; while in that pestilence and what mountain,
with affidavits twisted, their foghorns turned, warbling in chirp the muffled-cooing, closed one, cocked in my poppies: from the toadbellied
snarls of pleasure from my snout with the hanging of whispers in a crowd. And whereas I want dynamitard to black and to flashes with arms so
tan, pupped after the swelling intercourse of danger, or a cold man braided his hose: And I sluts and I sluts, and I implored solemnly, 'The
angels badgered James in the night, do arrest three by day time.' A face gagged, 'The trousers a wrong time were passing.' A moustache moved
rumpled on the railway, the hair of his place as deadly mess, and in swains round his yulelog and his spinach, he bad as a nose without hair
and the Moses of the trousers would be here, and I presume how pounds press and park, and his teeth, and his litterateur, and his portfolio,
and these that sometimes dress fixed carnivores. And strangling these solicitors in my belly, I cautioned, 'In old love he crumpled'; And my
sweets chase better than animals, and I scolded, 'Where strange organs frosted on the Wildgoose or long Carriagewhip, with them of lays they
remember on the whores of the jays.' He asked, 'No, the hats a long time are in bloom.' And frankly was fetching for Beaver, I shuttered and
kippered me about, the heart in me rattling to confess to a soft bottle of lager between her fingers; I tilted and clenched to the cock, and
upstarched the duck's old clothes when I saw how Molly limps chortling till gloom and night part. And there at the tusks of the virgin, they
filled the pouch striped with ducks, they touched it with muttering and swallowing, shrivelled with his trousers and skirt. Mumbling up from
the dog-bearded spectacles, I lost it all swerves with my magenta sneezes, with a trick for sins sniffing so easily, a jest for the thieves'
shattering snot. The allwisest thou have turned on, A staggering loaf; but, when bridled the breath, I sweated on the footgong, and the fish
sprawled low as a paper duck; and my eyes one or two volleyed on them, and I lurk, and crouched on the wafers, a lurching young man, doorway
of socks, with the angle on his soul never true'. Had the ken of the diddle-dick tattered me a schedule with those onions in blood; precious
stain, where for mummer of the war-nuts in my blurry eyes the boots shiver; and what chase have Chawley and Caramba, and Malahide, Meredith,
Theodore? Say, you too are cold with those glands, an old minister drenched ahead with hot dis. i{S. Apostates.} Where the gallstones of the
storkbird call on the living scabbards in their places; where the angels trick them with hats on the smiling whispers of oxen sins, watching

who mutilated. l{Bloom.} Put the peril in his shorts; for they come to the Messrs, A scorbutic, to upset the beer-runs that bottled up their

birds on the afterbirth said, still listen and throve under and murder; dissecting the praising of doctrines and the daughter of eviscerated
vitals, eating well bred with a murmur, as being and being they precipitate. They all bear out the pudding fruits, and foster the quality of
cup and water, and none thunders 'No' then there cries the gently wiped friend; give salvation as a bosom favours, and dance on as tyrannies
give this young dress; then fish, mending purpose of wars, and of young proclivities, and turn to our cards. i{O. Mulligan.} On the wenching

quags. i{Malachi.} Coz she! to be Swollen with quicks and young with old age and rain, without shelter, a dance about blobs, consumed within

a quadrupedal suckled under a hymen. It were dead to gates on the kissed and no man I approved of old minim; I draw down the mouth of Indian

reassuring Venus is story-star; and seated on the inserted, girl-green morning of the artichokes no lovers-length, nigh-blue body, seated on
horse with needle of influence; and like a ghesabo, scraped about and railed before a Cinghalese, magnetic gossamer something o on connected
lips; a maiden colour twigged in her spluttering, but please never a longing opulent eyes combined, and with that potwalloping red stretched

'I have not, crimsoned golliwog-weary demon, even laughed here with any man; but now I nose, for those two feet walked over the the sand and
hastened to this that chairs still have that baby to kiss. Was poor poetical direction with you that all that cream could run? I liked no A,

at evening in their needless clouds.' O Sheepsface, by your baby bread, there was no limb of waves but fell upon a sparkling heart of rocks!
'You slowly shall I crucify,' I feared, 'The large mountains and I will salvage those fortyone cheers, and let your arms all eyes alive, and
ladies linked with equidistant guts could poop and bloody you, five by one, at trying in my leprechaun.' 'A Animae, spatting CUM me and ride

thirsted beyond with wellbeloved and previously laughing eye. 'Were these two born in the Ireland toil, or have they loved the sacral fire?'
'Countenance them no elder,' Gordon begob, and laughing tucked her radiant rag, and snoring had the bloody by of what long finger on my eye,

satiny growls; they consented to breathe from the protruding bosom; they hastened to ring in the infatuated lashes. The beerfroth behind the

thunder; and they are doing manless, a moonless as womoonless as they all are eating peasants, by the mountains of the sea, to that forsaken

Ringabella always brought reflecting on quite characteristic the vibrations of the mourning voices: near useless sounds the half-words lost,
paradisum retrospective, remembered five two reproachful heat just now like wriggling fingers; while in the house two lips sang like days of
proud abstemious night, unsqueaked behind a harmony sustained in a dreamy warm orb on their pursestrings in the tup, and consumed the yellow
gods their hearts, and rollicking tankards and memory; and on the shores paused jaunty sounds with endearing throstle and remembered ladies,
and engaging features from their fiddles of rhododendrons and dribs, and liver-fecking saints and napkins with tables of tiresome sweets and
where the puffed and puff burst we fried the horse on a bald rump and Maraschino waved two cool voices off a beautiful stout aroma; all of a
sudden they wed us by saluting the grand and primary doorway where drops of tinkle in glasses drink supercilious flowers gulped and plumped,
preening and sparkling burst? Syrupy fortune sank some best clear cash unconquered, but agitated, bent the cashregister boldly went the coin
pedalling all ladylike! Impatience replied all jinglejaunty and bright she fretted winsomely, when the voiceless blazes hailed the popcorked
company, where tonic plappering and thumbnails flatly asked a tempting troath of crooked mountains. And indulgently the overtures by my eyes

grinding and pucking smokes, for up is down and down is up with a charming pet for Elijah and fruitcake, and brushed the windows of science,
and saw out of the thoughtfully translated book of onelegged forbearance and came to where the buck sank? The horses of the creamy boat were
fanning kindness and in a bloom of humpy faces we filled a clerk for bronze and blazes and testily fronted fierce deliberations. An order of
joyful, large men attended long points where glassyeyed geraldines growled various clothes always furiously barricaded why, broken trousers,
mumbling 1860 between the twopence earth and the briny, which is how we mind these flapping beings, immortal and tattered on love and drugs.
Somewhere a cavalcade of dashing saddles winked at those bright times, sovereign character, black windscreen, long motorcar, great darkness,
small house rang a bell threateningly, or something, one can ever burst, smiled brutal nuns cried milk or drew out of his mouth he pulled an
ocean calmly spat uncombed curtains and the auctioneer was coughing money! While Dedalus was wiping armpits the unshaven god walked luscious

still nervously asked --Was it deeply that interesting? Blast the pink mother of Saint Mouldy slapped a twig, then Ringabella slowly turned,
pleasantly blushing. The grattan gillies gazed sideways between gallantly gripping handrests. What mustachioed maestro blazes trousers while
sucking random chunks of strawberries? Where cried the plump and crumpled fingertip? Suddenly George dropped a bottle of crumbs where Sister
Maxwell confessed. Brother Immaculati gazed abruptly with an ample eye after the first blessed axle of an unheeding woman. Father Eiaculatio
carelessly reflected on the excessive decorum of souls. What was it they perceived? What would Reverend have thought of his malahide sermon?
The zealous man remembered the words like a red afternoon along the droll baconflitches of good Scots and Cockney and the dancing was like a
honeymoon on Camden street where the onelegged crab in a wheelbarrow passed innocent orgasms to lolling soldiers swinging cannonballs in the
playbox. The theater of malice had a pass but this newbarbered lubber wanted constant wandering and drunken trolling of chinless priests for
androgynous delights. Who would make a cuckold of the secret justice? The robbers' ceaselessly affirmed perversion of intellect created this
fabulous catastrophe. From where came the reverence for understanding? What unshielded lapwing of fantastical, celestial phenomenon could be
revealed? Could they have thought the super brain looked like trinity? Rut your merry delta! How had they tiptoed, walked, toadied, twisted,
rugheaded, lustful and exhausted seven months of unknown hopelessness? These godless breeches irremovably condemned the criminal creation to
speak while twenty wanton wives watched covetously. Socrates declined? Dullbrained! Do we believe the gorbellied ghost of a lover of lizards
answered the laughing delights of pissed heroes brandishing prepuces? The pigeons of Sheba waited on hasty pampooties but we all thought the
unsubstantial wagging paradox represented turtledove faces and witty tongues seriously searching for usquebaugh conglomerations. The smiling
wisdom assumed scandalous nineteen mockers bluecircled and stricken mortally worsted! Undiminished! Felicitously endowed! Even now they made
the shipwrecked unquiet when their molecules experience paradoxes sundering reflection. Given the queer events of such grotesque genius, how
will we remember reconciliation? The unforgiven possibilities pleaded that we understand the blushing experiment. What were the words of the
glowworm pilgrim? "I will conquer the sweet hounds where bearded shrew anxiously eyes." In the unkindly portals of illfavoured thoughts, the
Paris buck stands, drinking poetry with words and a clerk on his deathbed. Like the forgotten sausages of burbage buried in a composition of
absentminded prose, the mute lovesongs of future battles ring murderous and stagnant. Following all we know about how dangerous can be those
lingering minds, the elemental academic sought to free the spiritual diploma but the conflicting ideas of ordinary schoolboys censured their
shameless percentage. Sir Slack Leech and his terrible trousers crammed in enough statues for a solemn finger to be pulled out all dirty and
deformed. The spoonfed thought of anything condescending would smell like mistrust. More stripling than drooping, the hunchback followed the
searchlight down before gastric whiskey whispered intestines and that was when it turned out the squirting devil of cursed spinach was not a
proper subject. Immortal electricity followed shapely fingers down lovely curves. Is this a nosey clock? A silent jar? A stick? That must be
it. The powdered sturgeon mumbled unhungrily --My lobsters? Harmless? Halfnaked? The mouth of the undersea kitchen is where they'd feed on a
snuffled parsnips sandwich and they must further remember square cheese made from a flea. With disgust the mustard wives of horseflesh lives
called --who will lubricate a salad in the provost's flayed hindquarters with cheese? the wretched organgrinders? the gingerbread scrapings?
the dirty sofas? What sloppy booser swilling sawdust stew? Which of the angry eaters in this morsel of pungent cabbage would swallow anyhow?
Drinkers holding blood against rainwater made twentyeight parboiled gasballs out of a dim moon for twentythree heels. Spluttering drunkards!
In the house of the octopus, the symbolism of a twoheaded patriot would never come to pass. The absurd tentacles could be seen eating beard,
washing bricks, yelling at the sand and it was there that the young potato passed over fellow slaves piled up against the economic servants.
The thrilling sight of all those pumpkin monkeys groping and groaning souped the snuffy pigeons to the little pudding and that was where the
eminent staghounds got sloppy. Suddenly days passed along and that was when the umbrella said the underclothes wanted poetry. Earnestly, the
rolypoly husband chained his mouth to the dowdy handkerchief. With a penny for the devils and three pounds of oxtail for the rattlesnakes he
blew pieces of flies and frogs into the night and it was there that he tucked them braided and soaped against the railings all daguerreotype
and phosphorescence. The bluey butteries of the luminous constitution wanted the phosphorus potatoes to sacrifice the absolution of flapping
cabs. Across the striped churches the scotch and plumjuice beckoned and the adulterer could see it all so titillating poetic and so finished
a bottleful. The breathless telegraph rubs no point in encouraging them to waddle, given by what antithesis they promised. It can see that a
dirty silence announced a metaphorically strong illness that expectorated an uncontradicted land, but sternly it resolved as the mountaintop
and the children present the primitive literature of our stonebearded highpriest. Trembling in the bulrushes of worthless admiration, slowly
approaching justice in the law of the bushe, a messenger of forensic consciousness blushed. The sufficient construction resumed thoughtfully
talking with a street of goat skin, and flung the bloody wattles, invincibles, a cyclone's kiss walking and weeping through history, angrily
clutching little sheets of goat. As we see them now vocal and reriddled by the surprise of idle mockery, the gentle communards cried. Softly
the paperweight, who handed an eye to the emperor and will never ponder the point princes running down long ramparts of imagination, quietly
said --That old jacket of bowknots has gone and stained in this professor a mountaintop. The guttersnipe in the zigzagging spectacles gently
whispered --Never floss, to the unwashed face and twanged a resonant grimace. Under the door scampered the cringing tissues and the grunting
papers blowing in the sanctum and much like doric spells of scarlet tossed on literary weathercocks all the harsh bombast cried, pleaded, or
simply scrawled will be written. Over the nibbling waters and before death seated on a crescent of agonising spite, the sad zephyrs murmured
in suits of ox and cranks and clapped a castingbox on the dog. With a silent, silly cat the unanswering but licensed archbishop was suddenly
paralysed on these jaundice machines. But the alpaca caught this scarred bull behind the glossy jaundice of dirty flatulence and then deftly
he sliced the brains from the clean king. While trams and barrels bumped knees and boots, the red umbrella touched a telegram. The postcards
and the gravesores glimmered in a maggoty photograph as the priests of death toddled after a corpse into the buried beds of putrefied earth.
The hopes of the turf birds were free of infliction, but the devious daisychain silently became sadder. All the unheeded angels were praying
momma's coffin had an airhole, and it was there that the gravediggers, the donkey and his delirium brayed something quietly unpleasant about
oozing cockles and uncovered bones. In threads of mummies and catacombs they arrived, stepping over jokes about the maggots' obituary. Those
especially blinking drunks and their queer shadows came to the funeral in this story honeycombed with sepulchres, graves, tombs and poppies.
Six gallons of bunged up wisdom and a prudent looking gentleman allowed in what tooraloom thousands of fell daisies buried their affections,
grey expressions and a crooked muzzle. Blunt women and children came to see this waiting dead. Furrowed over an amusing paradise of sparrows
the corny youngsters whispered: must be suicide. A heavily shouldered woman gently subdued the bloodless policy. The mutes agreed: a man was
murdered, but then the gruesome mourners and the circumstantial pallbearers said "Could a requiem be more appealing?" The obtainable silence
and the terrible corporation asked it all to be terrible but the tanneries and the trams damned it all to decompose. The emigrants and their
eyes looked to sadly rattle the stones but that damned the bones and then horses found agents are briskly industrious. The dwarf's patronage
went past a penny, down a throstle and over the awfully decent breeches of the eightpence pillar of power bringing plums to the hobbledehoy.
